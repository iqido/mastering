	<meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Author posits that enlightenment is an attainable goal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Argues that meditation is a method for examining reality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very idea that the teachings of meditation can be mastered will arouse controversy within Buddhist circles. Even so, Ingram insists that enlightenment is an attainable goal, once our fanciful notions of it are stripped away, and we have learned to use meditation as a method for examining reality rather than an opportunity to wallow in “self-absorbed mindnoise”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingram sets out concisely the difference between concentration-based and insight (vipassana) meditation; he provides example practices; and most importantly he presents detailed maps of the states of mind we are likely to encounter, and the stages we must negotiate as we move through clearly-defined cycles of insight. It’s easy to feel overawed, at first, by Ingram’s assurance and ease in the higher levels of consciousness, but consistently he writes as a down-to-earth and compassionate guide—to the practitioner willing to commit themselves this is a glittering gift of a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Author&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel M. Ingram began entering into classical meditation territory as a teenager quite by accident and without knowing it crossed into territory that he would later call various names, including The Dark Night and the Knowledges of Suffering. He had no idea what had happened, but somehow knew that he had to find something. After being inspired by a good friend who got to the first stage of enlightenment after a retreat in centers in the Buddhist tradition, he began going on intensive insight meditation retreats in the US, India and Malaysia. By simply following the instructions he achieved the expected results, and has since become part of the global movement of meditation reform, a movement that seeks to preserve core meditation technology and supports, integrate helpful aspects from across traditions, refine the techniques and maps through exploration and verification, and spread the message that it can be done. It is also a movement to strip away the aspects of dogma, ritual,rigid hierarchy, myth and falsehood that hinder high-level practice and keep the culture of meditation mired in unhelpful taboos and misplaced effort. Dr. Ingram also has an MD, a Master's degree in Public Health, and a bachelor's degree in English literature. He practices in the U.S. as a board-certified emergency medicine physician. He hopes that those on the path will practice well, aim high and become accomplished practitioners who will help to train others to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"/>

&nbsp;FOREWORD AND WARNING</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When I was about 15
years old I accidentally ran into some of the classic early
meditation experiences described in the ancient texts and my
reluctant spiritual quest began. I did not realize what had happened,
nor did I realize that I had crossed something like a point of no
return, something I would later call the Arising and Passing Away. I
knew that I had had a very strange dream with bright lights, that my
entire body and world had seemed to explode like fireworks, and that
afterwards I somehow had to find something, but I had no idea what
that was. I philosophized frantically for years until I finally began
to realize that no amount of thinking was going to solve my deeper
spiritual issues and complete the cycle of practice that had already
started.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I had a very good
friend that was in the band that employed me as a sound tech and
roadie. He was in a similar place, caught like me in something we
would later call the Dark Night and other names. He also realized
that logic and cognitive restructuring were not going to help us in
the end. We looked carefully at what other philosophers had done when
they came to the same point, and noted that some of our favorites had
turned to mystical practices. We reasoned that some sort of non-dual
wisdom that came from direct experience was the only way to go, but
acquiring that sort of wisdom seemed a daunting task if not
impossible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He was a bit farther
along than I was in his spiritual crisis, and finally he had no
choice but to give it a try. He quit the music business, moved back
to California, and lived in a run down old mobile home, driving pizza
to save money so that he could go off on a spiritual quest. He
finally did some intensive meditation retreats and then eventually
took off to Asia for a year of intensive practice under the guidance
of meditation masters in the Burmese Theravada Buddhist tradition.
When he came back, the benefits of his practice were obvious, and a
few years later I began to try to follow a similar path.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In 1994, I began
going on intensive meditation retreats and doing a lot of daily
practice. I also ran into some very odd and interesting experiences,
and began to look around for more guidance on how to proceed and keep
things in perspective. Good teachers were few and far away, their
time limited and often expensive to obtain, and their answers to my
questions were often guarded and cryptic. Even my old music friend
was keeping most of what he knew to himself, and issues around
disclosure of meditation theory and personal practice details nearly
cost us our friendship.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Frustrated, I turned
to books, reading extensively, poring over texts both modern and
ancient looking for conceptual frameworks that might help me navigate
skillfully in territory that was completely outside my previous
experience. Despite having access to an astounding number of great
and detailed dharma books, I found that they left out lots of details
that turned out to be very important. I learned the hard way that
using conceptual frameworks that were too idealistic or that were not
fully explained could be as bad as using none at all. Further, I
found that much of the theory about progress contained ideals and
myths that simply did not hold up to reality testing, as much as I
wanted them to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I also came to the
profound realization that they have actually worked all of this stuff
out. Those darn Buddhists have come up with very simple techniques
that lead directly to remarkable results if you follow instructions
and get the dose high enough. While some people don’t like this
sort of cookbook approach to meditation, I am so grateful for their
recipes that words fail to express my profound gratitude for the
successes they have afforded me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Their simple and
ancient practices revealed more and more of what I sought. I found my
experiences filling in the gaps in the texts and teachings, debunking
the myths that pervade the standard Buddhist dogma and revealing the
secrets meditation teachers routinely keep to themselves. Finally, I
came to a place where I felt comfortable writing the book that I had
been looking for, the book you now hold in your hands.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This book is for
those who really want to master the core teachings of the Buddha and
who are willing to put in the time and effort required. It is also
for those who are tired of having to decipher the code of modern and
ancient dharma books, as it is designed to be honest, explicit,
straightforward and rigorously technical. Like many of the
commentaries on the Pali Canon, it is organized along the lines of
the three basic trainings that the Buddha taught: morality,
concentration and wisdom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Throughout this book
I have tried to be as utilitarian and pragmatic as possible, and the
emphasis is always on how to actually “get it” at the level that
makes some difference. All sections also assume to some degree that
you have a practice of some sort, hang out in some sort of spiritual
scene, and know a bit of the standard dharma lingo. All sections also
assume that you are willing to do the work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have tried to
include enough information to make this book capable of standing on
its own as a manual of meditation and for walking the spiritual path.
However, I have also tried to focus on those areas that I consider to
be my core competencies and also those areas of the spiritual path
that I do not feel have been adequately covered in the works that
have come before this one. This book shines in areas of technique and
the fine points of very high-level practice. However, the spiritual
life is vast beyond measure and cannot possibly be adequately covered
in a single book. Thus, I will often refer you to other excellent
sources for more details on those topics that I feel have already
been covered quite well by other authors. I strongly suggest checking
out at least some if not all of these other sources.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Like my own
practice, this book is heavily influenced by the teachings of the
late, great Mahasi Sayadaw, a Burmese meditation master and scholar
in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, and by those in his lineage and
outside it. There are numerous references to other excellent
traditions as well, some Buddhist and some not. It is my sincere wish
that all diligent students of meditation find something in this book
that is of practical value to them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have included a
few of my own experiences and labeled them as such. This is done to
try to add some sense of the reality of what is possible, both in
terms of successes and failures. They should add a human dimension to
the theory. However, if you find that these stories get in the way,
or if they seem to have too much of the quality of “let me tell you
about my personal spiritual quest,” please do us both a favor and
skip over them without a second thought.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have also written
this book in what is clearly my own voice. Those who have read this
work who know me tell me that they can almost hear me saying it. I
have also left in a lot of my neurotic stuff and made it as obvious
as I can. I will assert that anyone who writes puts their stuff in
there even if they try to hide it, so at least you should be able to
see it clearly rather than it being hidden and covert. If you want a
book that is just the straight dogma and theory without this sort of
voice, there are lots to choose from and I will mention a number
along the way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have also included
a modicum of social commentary, some of which has a definite bite to
it. Some of you may not find it helpful, or even find it quite
distasteful and offensive. Some of you will quickly dismiss it as
harsh or wrong speech. I am torn between the feeling that there
really are some important points in those sections and the
understanding that not everyone will be able to make good use of
information and opinions presented in such strong terms. Thus, I ask
you to please skip over those chapters and get to the friendlier or
more technical sections beyond them if you don’t find them helpful.
To facilitate doing so, I have included a star (asterisk) in the
titles of those chapters that contain potentially inflammatory
material so that they may be treated appropriately.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While I feel that
the points made in those chapters are important and potentially quite
valid and useful, they are not absolutely necessary for understanding
the chapters that follow them. The world is brimming with very nice
and friendly dharma books. There are hundreds available on the
shelves of any mega-bookstore. However, I believe that there is room
for a book that sometimes conveys its message in a very different
voice, though I respectfully give you the option to choose how much
of that voice you want to hear. It is the unrestrained voice of one
from a generation whose radicals wore spikes and combat boots rather
than beads and sandals, listened to the Sex Pistols rather than the
Moody Blues, wouldn’t know a beat poet or early ‘60s dharma bum
from a hole in the ground, and thought the hippies were pretty
friggin’ naïve, not that we don't owe them a lot. It is also the
unrestrained voice of one whose practice has been dedicated to
complete and unexcelled mastery of the traditional and hardcore
stages of the path rather than some sort of vapid New Age fluff or
pop psychological head-trip. If that ain’t you, consider reading
something else.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As a highly regarded
senior meditation teacher and scholar (who will remain anonymous)
said to me after skimming through an earlier draft of this book,
“Most Buddhists are just aging Boomers who want to do something to
feel better about themselves as they get older and are not really
interested in this sort of thing.” I wish them great success in
getting those valid needs met and so I must reluctantly advise such
individuals to avoid reading this book or at least the chapters
marked with a star. This is simultaneously an admission of the
limitations of this work, an invitation to adopt a more empowering
view of what is possible on the spiritual path, and a warning.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have had other
motivations for writing this book. A number of people have attempted
to have me be their meditation teacher. I have done what I can to
encourage them to practice well, go on retreats and explore, but as
soon as I get the sense that they are not into really doing the work
or are trying to idolize me in even small ways, I go out of my way to
alienate them completely. I greatly prefer the company of fellow
adventurers who wish to explore the mysteries of this life together
than any other sort of relationship. Dharma friends may be at
different stages in the practice and one friend may teach another
something useful, but this has a very different feel from people who
are formally teacher and student. Thus, writing this book allows me
to hand them the better part of what I know and say, “Here, if you
are really into it, there is more than enough here to allow you to
plunge as deep as you care to. If not, I have wasted little of my
time and can avoid being put on some strange pedestal or pillory, at
least to my face.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That said, I do have
the explicit goal of facilitating others to become living masters of
this material that they may go forth and help to encourage more
people to do so. The more people are able to teach from a place of
deeply established personal experience, the more people will be able
to learn the dharma well, and the saner and happier the world will
be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This brings me to
the question of the issue of what some would call hierarchy. The
simple fact is that there are those that have attained to what is
called awakening, enlightenment, realization, etc. and those that
haven't. There are those with strong concentration abilities and
those those without. There are those who have their morality trip
together and hose that don't. There are those who are masters of some
things and those that have more work to do. While there is a
strangely pervasive movement in the West to try to imagine everyone
is equal in the world of spirituality, it is obviously completely
delusional and wrong-headed. When I went looking for teachers and
friends to practice with and help me along, rather than get mad that
some people claimed to know more than I did, I was excited by the
opportunity, however rare, to study with people who knew what they
were doing. This just makes sense. Read this as another warning: if
you get good enough at these things, people will often have bad
reactions to you if you go around talking about it, and the number
who will instead find your achievements a source of inspiration and
empowerment, as they rightly should, will likely be few.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On that same front,
it is a very strange thing to have such a completely different
language, set of experiences and perspectives from most of the people
around me. I can often feel like an alien wearing a trench coat of
normalcy, and I dream of a world where conversations about the sorts
of events and insights that have come to dominate my everyday
experience are much more common and normal. Reading between the
lines, you should take this admission as yet another warning. If you
get way into this stuff, you will discover this same loneliness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I should also
mention that I consider myself and many of those who hail from the
lineages from which I primarily draw to be dharma cowboys, mavericks,
rogues, and outsiders. Really wanting to get somewhere is a sure
ticket to feeling this way in most Western Buddhist circles. What is
ironic is that I also see myself as an extreme traditionalist. The
strange thing is that these days to be a Buddhist traditionalist, one
who really tries to plunge the depths of the heart, mind and body as
the Buddha so clearly admonished his followers to do, is to fly in
the face of much of mainstream meditation culture.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In that same vein, I
should further mention that the path I have followed has been
dangerous, destabilizing more often than calm, excruciating more
often than pleasant, harder to integrate than most other dharma paths
I have heard of, and in general quite a rough ride. It has also been
profound, amazing, and more glorious than most other paths I have
heard tell of. Surfing the ragged edges of reality has been asier for
me than slowing the thing down. In my explorations, accidents and
adventures, I have learned a lot about not only how to make very fast
progress in meditation but also a lot about how to do so without
completely wiping out. I hope that I can pass on some of the
knowledge of both in this book. This should be seen as another
warning. This book and the path presented in it are not for the
damaged and unstable spiritual seeker. You have to have your
psychological trip fairly together to be able to handle the intense
techniques, side effects and results I am about to discuss.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I would like to
thank the very many people whose influence, friendship, support and
kindness went into making this work what it is, though they are way
too numerous to list here. This is an interdependent universe, and so
to write that this work is simply by me is not in accord with
reality. It would be absurd not to acknowledge the extensive support
of Carol Ingram, Sonja Boorman, David Ingram, Christina Jones,
Christopher Titmuss, Sharda Rogell, Bill Hamilton, Kenneth Folk and
Robert Burns, all of who were very instrumental in making what is
good in this book and my own practice possible. I would also like to
thank John Hawley, Roger Windsor, Daniel Rizzuto and Michael Wade for
all their help with editing. However, the responsibility for any
flaws this work may contain must fall squarely on me. I can’t be
sure that all of these fine people would even want their names
associated with this work, but I reserve the right to express my deep
gratitude nonetheless.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A brief note on
style... The English language has no great way to use pronouns that
refer to a single person without getting gender-specific. Various
solutions exist, such as constantly using “he/she” (which can be
very distracting), alternating between “he” and “she”, and
recasting sentences in the plural, where the pronoun “they” may
be used. For better or for worse, I am going to use the pronoun
“they” to mean “he/she,” thus using what is ordinarily a
plural pronoun with verbs in the singular. I am not particularly
thrilled with this solution, but I don’t think it is much worse
than the others. Should a reader disagree, I hope that he/she will
find a way to forgive me, or at least that she will understand the
problem, making room in his heart for one more author struggling with
this linguistic limitation. I must also admit that I am somewhat
erratic in my use of capital letters, and you may just have to Live
With It.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">May this work be for
the benefit of all beings. May you realize what you are truly looking
for, pursue it relentlessly despite all obstacles, and find it.</p>

the Foreword and Warning, do so now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Buddhist path
has often been called a “spiritual path,” and this use of
religious language can be very inspiring for some people. The
Buddhist path could also be thought in terms of a scientific
experiment, a set of exercises that the Buddha and those who have
followed him have claimed lead to very specific effects, effects that
they deemed worthwhile. Using this sort of practical language can
also be very inspiring for some people. In an attempt to inspire a
wide audience, I will use both spiritual and practical or technical
language when discussing these issues. However, my preference is
generally for the practical language. You could throw out all of the
spiritual trappings on the Buddhist path and still have a set of
basic practices that lead to the effects promised. You could also
keep all of the spiritual trappings, do the basic practices, and
produce the same results, assuming of course that you had the extra
time and resources necessary to do both.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Part I contains some
traditional lists that were taught by the Buddha and relate directly
to spiritual training. They make important and practical points in
very concise ways. These teachings were made compact and portable on
purpose so that people could remember them and use them. It is their
very simplicity that makes them so practical and down to earth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I, however, am going
to take these very compact teachings and go on and on about them. It
turns out that the Buddha sometimes made things so simple that we are
left wondering what the heck he was talking about and how to do
something useful with his teachings. Basically he was saying, “Get
to know your actual reality really, really, really well, and try to
do right by yourself and the world.” As we all know, this is not
always as easy as it sounds, so that is why I include all of the
additional commentary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, these
teachings are designed to help people get in touch with their reality
in some way that makes a difference. They can also help people avoid
some of the common pitfalls on the spiritual path and in life in
general, some of which I will talk about later.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To that end, we will
begin with an introduction to the Three Trainings, <b>morality</b> ,
<b>concentration</b> and <b>wisdom</b> . The Three Trainings
encompass the sum total of the Buddhist path. Thus, they will be used
as the framework for this book. The Three Trainings involve skills
that we consciously and explicitly try to master. Each training has
its own specific set of assumptions, agendas, practices, and
standards for success in those practices. These are actually fairly
different from each other, and all sorts of problems can arise if we
mix these up and use the assumptions of one training when pursuing
the others. Each training also has its common pitfalls, limitations,
and shadow sides. These are rarely made clear, and the failure to do
so has caused much confusion. Thus, I will do my best to make them
clear, particularly in Part II (Light and Shadows). Each training
also has specific standards for success and mastery. These can
sometimes seem a bit technical, particularly the maps of the high
concentration states and the stages of insight, so I will wait until
Part III (Mastery) to present these in order to keep Part I focused
on the basic frameworks and practices that make the whole thing
possible in the first place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While I think that
each part of this book contributes to the whole, there are reasons
why you might want to skip to certain sections first and fill in the
rest later. For instance, if you are having powerful visions or
Kundalini experiences, you might want to read the first few chapters
of Part III and then go back and read the rest. If you are simply
interested in the maps of the stages of insight, go straight to the
chapter called The Progress of Insight. If you just want to get right
to some core insight practices, read the chapters on The Three
Characteristics and The Seven Factors of Enlightenment. Should you be
in a mood for some scathing social commentary, the beginning of Part
II is for you. If you just want to hear my take on enlightenment,
then Models of the Stages of Enlightenment might be a good place to
start. I struggled for a long time debating whether to present the
maps that tell what these practices lead to at the beginning or at
the end of the book. I have included them last, but you might be the
sort who wants to see them first, and if so you should read the
chapter called The Three Characteristics and then skip straight to
Part III. In my ideal world, everyone would read through this book
two or three times cover-to-cover and then work on committing the
more important sections to memory.</p>

2. MORALITY, THE FIRST AND LAST TRAINING</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The original Pali
word for this training is <i>sila</i>, which I am translating as
“morality.” People translate it in various ways, with some other
possibilities being “virtue” and “decency.” Regardless of the
word we choose, it is likely to have both positive and negative
implications. If the word “morality” bothers you due to the
associations that it brings to mind, take a look at the assumptions,
agendas, and practices of this training and come up with your own
word for it. I don’t think that it is so important what we call it.
I do, however, think that we should give some attention to trying to
live it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">From my point of
view, training in morality has as its domain all of the ordinary ways
that we live in the world. When we are trying to live the good life
in a conventional sense, we are working on training in morality. When
we are trying to work on our emotional, psychological and physical
health, we are working at the level of training in morality. When we
philosophize, we are working on training in morality. When we
exercise, we are working on training in morality. When we try to take
care of ourselves or others, we are working on training in morality.
When we try to defend the environment, reform the government, or make
this world a better place, we are working on training in morality.
When we try to find a good and helpful job, try to build a healthy
marriage or raise healthy children, or shave our heads and move to a
remote desert, we are working on training in morality. Whatever we do
in the ordinary world that we think will be of some benefit to others
or ourselves is an aspect of working on this first training.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The second two
trainings, those having to do with attaining unusual states of mind
and those having to do with ultimate realizations, have limits, in
that we can master them absolutely. However, this cannot be said of
the first training. There is no limit to the degree of skill that can
be brought to how we live in the world. Thus, morality is also the
last training, the training that we will have to work on for all of
our life. We may be able to attain to astounding states of
consciousness and understand the true nature of reality, but what
people see and what is causal are the ways that these abilities and
understandings translate into how we live in the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are basic
assumptions that are extremely helpful when undertaking training in
morality. It is very helpful to assume that some sort of basic moral
code is helpful for getting along in this world, and thus that there
is some practical benefit to be derived from training in morality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is also helpful
to assume in some loose and non-dogmatic way that the more good we do
in the world, the more good there will be in that world, and thus the
more good things will happen to us and all other beings. It is also
worth assuming the corollary of this, that the more we do bad things
in the world, the more bad things will be in that world for us and
for all beings. These assumptions are not unique to Buddhism nor are
they in any way extraordinary. Societies and traditions throughout
the ages have advocated that we find a place in our life for these
assumptions. Realize that defining bad and good is often very much a
question of perspective, but don’t fall into the paralyzing trap of
imagining that it is useless to try anyway. It is better to try to do
your best and fail than not try at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, we are
assuming that what we think, say and do have consequences. When
undertaking training in morality, we are assuming that we can control
what we think, say and do, thus creating consequences that are
beneficial. Rather than accepting our current level of intellectual,
emotional and psychological development as being beyond our power to
change, we consciously and explicitly take the empowering view that
we can work with these aspects of our lives and change them for the
better. We assume that we can change our world and our attitudes
towards our world. We take responsibility for our actions and their
consequences.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, as a part
of our empowerment, we assume that the more of our resources and
abilities we bring to this training, the likelier we will be to
succeed. We have a body, we have reason, we have our intuition, we
have our heart, and we have ability to learn and remember. We have a
community of others with wisdom to share, we have books and other
media that contain advice for living the good life, and we have our
friends and family. We can draw on all of this and more to try to
live a good life, a life where our thoughts, words and deeds reflect
as closely as possible the standards we have consciously adopted and
defined for &nbsp;ourselves. The more consciously engaged we are with
our task, the more we are likely to be successful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Crucial to the
control of what happens in our lives is our intent. Thus, training in
morality places a lot of emphasis on intent, with the basic
assumption being that the more our intentions are kind and
compassionate, the more we are likely to be able to manifest kind and
compassionate thoughts, words and deeds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, it is
helpful to assume that training in morality requires us to pay
attention to what is happening in our lives. When we are not paying
attention to what we are thinking, saying and doing, we will not
easily be able to craft these in a way that fits with the assumptions
of this training. If we are not paying attention to what the
consequences of our thoughts, words and deeds are, both in the short
term and the long term, we are unlikely to be able to gain enough
experience to be able to guide our training in morality successfully.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is also helpful
to assume that training in morality will help us when we get to
formal meditation practices (the next two trainings in concentration
and wisdom), providing a foundation of good mental and physical
habits that can support those practices. Thus, even if we have little
interest in being moral because of the benefits it can bring, if we
are interested in obtaining the results of the other two trainings,
we should also engage in training in morality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These assumptions
naturally lead to the specific agendas we have for what happens when
undertaking training in morality. We consciously aspire to have the
actions of our body, speech and mind live in a way that fits with the
assumptions of this training. In short, we have standards for our
mental, emotional and physical lives and we try our best to live up
to those standards. When we are working on training in morality, we
consciously cultivate actions, words and thoughts that we deem to be
kind and compassionate. By “kind,” I mean that we work to promote
the happiness and welfare of ourselves and others. By
“compassionate,” I mean that we work to relieve the suffering of
ourselves and others. Thus, our agenda is for our intentions to be
kind and compassionate, for our minds to be aware of what we are
thinking, saying, and doing, and for our experience to tell us as
best it can how to craft our life to reflect our intentions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Training in morality
tends to be discussed in terms of what one shouldn’t do and also
what one should do. The standard Buddhist short-list of the five
things that one should try to avoid, called “The Five Precepts”
are: killing, stealing, lying, taking mind altering substances that
lead to heedlessness, and using sexual energy in ways that are
harmful. These are obviously not unique to Buddhism, and seem to be
part of the basic set of standards for behavior that societies and
cultures throughout the ages have found to be helpful and practical.
The standard list of things that one should try to do includes being
kind, compassionate and appreciative of the successes of others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Wrestling with the
question of how we can meet this fairly reasonable standard and yet
honor where we are and what is going on around us is the practice of
this first training. We will make all kinds of mistakes that can be
very educational when trying to work on this first training; if you
mess up, remember to be kind to yourself!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are many great
techniques for cultivating a more decent way of being in the world,
but there are no magic formulations. You must figure out how to be
kind to yourself and all beings in each moment. As training in
morality takes into account all of the ordinary ways in which we try
to live a good and useful life, it is so vast a subject that I
couldn’t possibly give anything resembling a comprehensive
treatment of it here. However, if you wish for further elaboration on
some of the basics of training in morality, I suggest that you check
out some of the following works:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><u>For a Future to
be Possible</u>, by Thich Nhat Hanh A Heart as Wide as the World and
Lovingkindness, the&nbsp; Revolutionary Art of Happiness, both by
Sharon Salzburg Light on Enlightenment, by Christopher Titmuss, <u>A</u>
<u>Path</u> <u>With</u> <u>Heart</u>, by Jack Kornfield</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Training in morality
at its best is grounded in a theoretical or direct appreciation of
one more assumption, that of interconnectedness. Interconnectedness
at this level means an appreciation of the fact that we are all in
this together and that we all share the wish to be happy. When we
take into consideration our own needs and the needs of those around
us, we are more likely to be naturally kind and considerate of
ourselves and others. Thus, we try to make it a habit to try to take
into ccount the feelings, opinions and welfare of those around us.
The obvious trap here is to simultaneously fail to take into account
our own needs. Work on balancing both in a way that is sustainable
and healthy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are countless
other pitfalls we can run into when training in morality, as it is
such a vast area of work. I will spend a lot of time in Part II
detailing some of the more common side effects and shadow sides of
training in morality, but realize that it is an endless subject.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, one pitfall
that must be addressed here, as it is so common, is that of guilt. We
have grown up in a culture in which we can be extremely hard on
ourselves, causing ourselves astounding amounts of pain to little
good effect. If we can learn to substitute wise remorse, a remorse
that simply says, “Well, that didn’t work, and this is
unfortunate. I should try my best to figure out why and hopefully do
something better next time,” we will be much more able to train
successfully in living a good and useful life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some people
unfortunately seem to think that the primary message of training in
morality is that they should continuously cultivate the feeling that
they have taken up a heavy yoke of responsibility and
self-oppression. In fact, some people seem to revel in that
unfortunate feeling. Those more fortunate will think, “It is so
much fun to try to live a good, healthy and useful life! What a joy
it is to find creative ways to do this!” There are few things more
helpful on the spiritual path and life in general than a positive
attitude.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, the related
and all too common pitfall is that people stop having fun and trying
to be successful in worldly terms. There is absolutely no reason for
this. If you can have fun in healthy ways, have fun! It’s not just
for breakfast anymore. Also, success is highly recommended for
obvious reasons. Pick a flexible vision of success in the ordinary
sense for yourself and go for it! Play to win. This is your life, so
make it a great one. There is no reason not to try, so long as you
can do so in a kind and compassionate way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One more great thing
about the first training is that it really helps with the next
training: concentration. So, here's a tip: if you are finding it hard
to concentrate because your mind is filled with guilt, judgment, envy
or some other hard and difficult thought pattern, also work on the
first training, kindness. It will be time well spent.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5444_1179888903"></a><a name="3__CONCENTRATION__THE_SECOND_TRA"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_6"></a>
3. CONCENTRATION, THE SECOND TRAINING</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On to concentration,
the ability to steady the mind on whatever you wish and attain
unusual and profound altered states of consciousness. Training in
concentration relates to formal meditation practice. It is also
called training in “samadhi” (meaning depths of meditation), or
sometimes “samatha practice.” Concentration practice involves
working at a level that might be considered unusual, particularly
contrasted with the ordinary level of training in morality. Training
in morality is something to which everyone can relate. Training in
concentration is only easy to relate to if you have attained to
unusual states of consciousness or at least have faith that they can
be attained.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Training in
concentration has had thousands of pages dedicated to it, and there
are probably thousands of concentration exercises. Some very commonly
used objects of meditation are the breath (my personal favorite),
one’s posture, a mantra or koan, a candle flame, various
visualization exercises, and even the experience of concentration
itself. The object you choose should be one on which you would be
happy to steady your mind.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The essential point
about meditation is this: <i>to</i> <i>get</i> <i>anywhere</i> <i>in</i>
<i>meditation</i> <i>you</i> <i>need</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>able</i>
<i>to</i> <i>really</i> <i>steady</i> <i>the</i> <i>mind</i> <i>and</i>
<i>be</i> <i>present</i>. That's just all there is to it and it is
largely a question of just doing it. There is an important shift that
happens in people's practice when they really make the commitment to
developing concentration and follow through with it. <i>Until</i> <i>one</i>
<i>does</i> <i>this</i>, <i>not</i> <i>much</i> <i>is</i> <i>likely</i>
<i>to</i> <i>happen</i> <i>in</i> <i>one’s</i> <i>meditative</i>
<i>practice</i>! If you decide to do a concentration practice, stay
on that object like a rabid dog until you have enough stability and
skill to let the mind rest on it naturally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first formal
goal when training in concentration is to attain something called
“access concentration,” meaning the ability to stay consistently
with your chosen object with relative ease to the general exclusion
of distractions. This is the basic attainment that allows you to
access the higher stages of concentration and also to begin the path
of insight (the third training), so make attaining access
concentration your first goal in your meditative practice. You will
know when you have it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, <u>the</u>
<u>essential</u> <u>formal</u> <u>concentration</u> <u>practice</u>
<u>instructions</u> <u>are</u>: pick an object (the list above is a
great place to begin), find a place to practice where you are as free
from distractions as possible, pick a sustainable posture (it doesn’t
really matter so much), focus your attention on the object as
completely and consistently as possible for the duration of that
practice period, allowing as few lapses in concentration as possible,
and learn to stabilize all of your attention on that object. The more
you practice and the better your practice, the better you will
become. Find the balance of effort and steadiness that works for you.
Practice again and again until you can attain access concentration.
While this paragraph may seem trite or sparse, it contains the formal
instructions on how to begin training in concentration.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Should you need
someone to tell you how long to practice, start with 10 minutes a day
and work up to an hour or two each day as your life allows. If you
can learn to hold your attention completely on your chosen object for
even one solid minute, you have some strong concentration skills.
That said, you might have 10 hours a day to devote to practice. Don’t
let me hold you back! How long it will take you to develop access
concentration is dependent upon a number of factors including
practice conditions, your natural and cultivated concentration
ability, the strength of your drive to succeed, and how much you
practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sharpening your
concentration may help almost everything you do, and can provide a
mental and emotional stability that can be very useful. Concentration
can also lead to some very nice states called “jhanas” and other
names. These can be extremely blissful and peaceful. Being able to
access these states of mind can be ridiculously enjoyable and can
increase steadiness and stability of mind. These are of value in and
of themselves and also serve the important function in the Buddhist
tradition of providing a disposable foundation for insight practices,
i.e. the third training.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will leave off
describing the high concentration attainments until Part III so as to
keep this section focused on the essential skills necessary for
meditation, as once you gain access concentration getting into those
states is very easy. Until you can get into access concentration, you
ain’t got squat. Thus, pick an object, practice well and often,
learn to attain to access concentration, finish reading this book,
and by that point everything should be very straightforward.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it must be said
that concentration practices, like all practices, have their shadow
sides. For instance, high and unusual experiences can become
addictive and seductive, causing them to receive more attention and
focus than they deserve. They can also lead to people becoming very
otherworldly and ungrounded, very much the way that hallucinogens
can. They can also bring up lots of our psychological “stuff.”
This last limitation could be a benefit if we are in a mood to deal
with this stuff. Perhaps the most important limitations of
concentration practices is that they do not lead directly to the
insights and permanent understandings that come from training in
wisdom, as much as we might like them to. That brings us to the third
training...</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5446_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_7"></a><a name="4__WISDOM__THE_THIRD_TRAINING"></a>
4. WISDOM, THE THIRD TRAINING</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The third training
in the list is wisdom, in this case a very special kind of wisdom
that I will often call “ultimate” or “fundamental” wisdom.
This may also be rendered as “understanding” or “insight.”
The whole trick to this training is to understand the truth of the
sensations that make up our present experience. The great mystics
from all traditions have reported that there is something remarkable
and even enlightening about our ordinary experiences if we take the
time to look into them very carefully. Those that undertake training
in wisdom have decided to do the experiment and see for themselves if
this is true or if those old dead dudes were just making it all up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Obviously, the first
assumption that must be made is that there is some understanding that
is completely beyond any ordinary understanding, even beyond the
altered states of consciousness that can be attained if we train in
concentration. The next assumption is that there are specific
practices that can lead to that understanding if we simply do them.
The third and perhaps most vital assumption is that <i>we</i> <i>can</i>
<i>do</i> <i>them</i> <i>and</i> <i>be</i> <i>successful</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The assumption that
is rarely stated explicitly but often implied is that we must be
willing to stay on a sensate level, at the level of the actual
sensations that make up experiences, if we wish to gain the insights
that are promised by the mystics. The corollary of this assumption is
that we must be willing to set aside periods of time during which we
abandon the ordinary way of working in the world that is called
training in morality and even the unusual way of working with altered
states of consciousness that is called training in concentration. We
assume that the teachings on wisdom point to universal truths, truths
that can be perceived in all types of experience without exception.
We assume that if we can simply know our sensate experience clearly
enough, then we will come to understand for ourselves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The primary agenda
for doing insight practices is to increase our perceptual abilities
so that the truths mentioned by the great mystics become obvious to
us. Thus, rather than caring what we think, say or do, or caring
about what altered state of consciousness we are in, <i>when</i>
<i>training</i> <i>in</i> <i>wisdom</i> <i>we</i> <i>actively</i>
<i>work</i> <i>to</i> <i>simply</i> <i>increase</i> <i>the</i> <i>speed</i>,
<i>precision</i>, <i>consistency</i> <i>and</i> <i>inclusiveness</i>
<i>of</i> <i>our</i> <i>experience</i> <i>of</i> <i>all</i> <i>the</i>
<i>quick</i> <i>little</i> <i>sensations</i> <i>that</i> <i>make</i>
<i>up</i> <i>our</i> <i>experience</i>, <i>whatever</i> <i>and</i>
<i>however</i> <i>they</i> <i>may</i> <i>be</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, <u>the</u>
<u>essential</u> <u>formal</u> <u>insight</u> <u>meditation</u>
<u>instructions</u> <u>are</u>&nbsp; : find a place where the
distractions are tolerable, pick a stable and sustainable posture,
and for a defined period of time notice every single sensation that
makes up your reality as best you can. Just as with concentration
practices, more time and more diligent practice pays off. These
simple instructions can easily seem overwhelming, vague or strangely
trivial to many people, and so I am going to spend a lot of time
laying out a large number of empowering concepts and more structured
practices that have helped countless practitioners over thousands of
years to follow these basic instructions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While the Three
Trainings all contain some similar elements, there are some important
contrasts that must be made between them. The gold standard for
training in morality is how kind and compassionate our intentions are
and how well we lead a useful and moral life. The gold standard for
training in concentration practices is how quickly we can enter into
highly altered states of consciousness, how long we can stay in them,
and how refined, complete and stable we can make those states. The
gold standard for insight practices is that we can quickly and
consistently see the true nature of the numerous quick sensations
that make up our whole reality, regardless of what those sensations
are, allowing us to cut to a level of understanding that goes utterly
beyond specific conditions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is absolutely
vital that the differences between these gold standards be
understood. Considered this way, these gold standards do not overlap
and may even seem to contradict one another. This is a very practical
assumption. As these differences seem to be extremely difficult to
explain clearly, I will make this basic point again and again
throughout this book.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, having gained
enough morality to be temporarily free of excessive negative mind
states and enough concentration to steady the mind somewhat, look
into the bare truth of the sensations of this moment. This is called
insight meditation and other names, and it is designed to produce
wisdom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sounds simple, and
while it is, it also isn't. There are many types of insight that we
may derive from experiencing the world. Usually, we might think of
training in wisdom as having to do with relative issues like how to
live our lives. In this sense, one might just try to be wiser.
Perhaps we could skillfully reflect on something that went badly and
see if perhaps in the future some wisdom gained from that experience
might change the way we live our life. This is an ordinary form of
wisdom, and so the insights we derive from such reflections and
observations are insights into the ordinary world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
these sorts of reflections can only take us so far, and to really get
what the Buddha was talking about, we need to go far beyond these
conventional definitions of wisdom and attain to ultimate insights by
doing insight practices. Many people try to make insight practices
into an exercise that will produce both insights into the ordinary
world and also ultimate insights. I have come to the conclusion that
<i>we</i> <i>should</i> <i>not</i> <i>count</i> <i>on</i> <i>ultimate</i>
<i>teachings</i> <i>to</i> <i>illuminate</i> <i>our</i> <i>relative</i>
<i>issues</i> <i>or</i> <i>vice</i> <i>versa</i>, and so I feel that
it is extremely important to keep the relative and ultimate wisdom
teachings separate. Failure to do so causes endless problems and
makes progress on either front more difficult rather than easier.
Thus, I will revisit this topic again and again throughout this work,
doing my best to clearly differentiate those practices that produce
ordinary wisdom from those practices that fall within the third
training and lead to ultimate realizations that are independent of
our relative insights.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are many
wisdom traditions and many styles of insight practices. I will lay
out a number of them explicitly and hint at many others in the
chapters that follow. When choosing an insight tradition, I would
suggest you look for a tradition that is tried and true, meaning that
is either very old and well tested, or at least can, in modern times,
demonstrate that it consistently leads to unshakable realizations. I
can verify that the specific practices I will present lead to the
effects I promise if they are applied as recommended. Even better,
you should verify this for yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A brief note of
caution here: occasionally, when people begin to really get into
spirituality, they may get a bit fascinated with it and may forget
some of the useful relative wisdom they have learned from before.
Caught up in “ultimate wisdom” and their “spiritual quest,”
they can sometimes abandon conventional wisdom and other aspects of
their “former life” to a degree that may not be very wise. They
falsely imagine that by training in insight they are also mastering
or transcending the first training, that of living in the ordinary
world. <i>We</i> <i>awaken</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>actual</i>
<i>truth</i> <i>of</i> <i>our</i> <i>life</i> <i>in</i> <i>all</i> <i>of</i>
<i>its</i> <i>conventional</i> <i>aspects</i> <i>by</i> <i>definition</i>,
<i>so</i> <i>make</i> <i>sure</i> <i>that</i> <i>yours</i> <i>is</i>
<i>a</i> <i>life</i> <i>you</i> <i>will</i> <i>want</i> <i>to</i>
<i>wake</i> <i>up</i> <i>to</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In summary, by
seeing deeply into the truth of our own experience, profound and
beneficial transformations of consciousness are definitely possible.
You guessed it, we’re talking about enlightenment, The Big E,
awakening, freedom, Nirvana, the unconditioned, and all of that. The
arising of this understanding is the primary focus of this book.
There are actually lots of interesting insights that typically occur
even before awakening. Again, there are no magic formulae for
producing ultimate insights, except for the Three Characteristics...</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5448_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_8"></a><a name="5__THE_THREE_CHARACTERISTICS"></a>
5. THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Three
Characteristics are so central to the teachings of the Buddha that it
is almost inconceivable how little attention the vast majority of
so-called insight meditators pay to them. They are <b>impermanence</b>,
<b>unsatisfactoriness</b>, and <b>no</b>-<b>self</b> . I cannot
possibly stress enough the usefulness of trying again and again to
really understand these three qualities of all experience. They are
the stuff from which ultimate insight at all levels comes, pure and
simple. They are the marks of ultimate reality. Every single time I
say, “understand the true nature of things,” what I mean is,
“understand the Three Characteristics.” To really understand them
is to be enlightened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Somehow this
exceedingly important message just doesn't typically seem to get
through to insight meditators, and thus they spend so much time doing
anything but looking precisely moment to moment into the Three
Characteristics. They may be thinking about something, lost in the
stories and tape loops of the mind, trying to work on their stuff,
philosophizing, trying to quiet the mind, or who knows what, and this
can go on for year after year, retreat after retreat, and of course
they wonder why they don't have more insight yet. This is a tragedy
of monumental proportions, but you do not have to be part of it! You
can be one of those insight meditators that knows what to do, does
it, and finally “gets it” in the grandest sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The big message here
is: drop the stories, find a physical object like the breath or body
or pain or pleasure or whatever, and look into the Three
Characteristics precisely and consistently! Drop to the level of bare
sensations! This is vipassana, insight meditation, or whatever you
want to call it. It is the way of the Buddhas. All the “opening to
it,” “just being with it,” “letting it go” and all of that
are quite important, as we will see later, but insight meditators
must, repeat, must, look into the following:</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5450_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_9"></a><a name="IMPERMANENCE"></a>
IMPERMANENCE</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>All</b> <b>things</b>
<b>are</b> <b>impermanent</b>. This is one of the most fundamental
teachings of the Buddha and the second to last sentence he uttered
before he died: “All phenomena are impermanent! Work out your
salvation with diligence!” In his last words, he said everything
you need to know to do insight practices. Things come and go. Nothing
lasts for even an instant! Absolute transience is truly the
fundamental nature of experiential reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What do I mean by
“experiential reality?” I mean the universe of sensations that
you actually experience. There are many gold standards for reality.
<i>However</i>, <i>when</i> <i>doing</i> <i>insight</i> <i>practices</i>,
<i>the</i> <u>only</u> <i>useful</i> <i>gold</i> <i>standard</i> <i>for</i>
<i>reality</i> <i>is</i> <i>your</i> <i>own</i> <i>sensate</i>
<i>experience</i>. From the conventional point of view, things are
usually thought to be there even when you can no longer experience
them, and are thus assumed with only circumstantial evidence to be
somewhat stable entities. Predictability is used to assume continuity
of existence. For our day-to-day lives, this assumption is adequate
and often very useful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, you
could close your eyes, put down this book, and then pick it up again
where you left it without opening your eyes. From a pragmatic point
of view, this book was where you left it even when you were not
experiencing it in any way. However, when doing insight practices, it
just happens to be much more useful to assume that things are only
there when you experience them and not there when you don’t. Thus,
<i>the</i> <i>gold</i> <i>standard</i> <i>for</i> <i>reality</i> <i>when</i>
<i>doing</i> <i>insight</i> <i>practices</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i>
<i>sensations</i> <i>that</i> <i>make</i> <i>up</i> <i>your</i>
<i>reality</i> <i>in</i> <i>that</i> <i>instant</i>. Sensations not
there at that time do not exist, and thus only the sensations arising
in that instant do exist. In short, the vast majority of what you
usually think of as making up your universe doesn’t exist the vast
majority of the time, from a pure sensate point of view. This is
exactly, precisely and specifically the point. Knowing this directly
leads to freedom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is wise to
reflect on death and all of that, for it is useful and true. This is
a reflection on ordinary reality and thus an aspect of training in
morality that is commonly used to develop motivation to train in
insight. Far better to see one sensation arise and pass away. What do
I mean by this? I mean that sensations arise out of nothing, do their
thing, and vanish utterly. Gone. Utterly gone. Then the next
sensation arises, does its thing, and disappears completely. “That's
the stuff of modern physics,” one might say. “What does that have
to do with practice?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It has everything to
do with practice! We can experience this, because the first set of
vibrations we have access to isn't actually that fast. Vibrations.
That's right, vibrations. That's what this first characteristic
means: that reality vibrates, pulses, appears as discrete particles,
is like TV snow, the frames of a movie, a shower of vanishing flower
petals, or however you want to say it. Some people can get all into
complex wave or particle models here, but don't. Just look into your
actual experience, especially something nice and physical like the
motion and sensations of the breath in the abdomen, the sensations of
the tips of the fingers, the lips, the bridge of the nose, or
whatever. Instant by instant try to know when the actual physical
sensations are there and when they aren't. It turns out they aren't
there a good bit of the time, and even when they are there, they are
changing constantly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We are typically
quite sloppy about what are physical sensations and what are mental
sensations (memories, mental images, and mental impressions of other
sensations). These two kinds of sensations actually oscillate back
and forth, a back and forth interplay, one arising and passing and
then the other arising and passing, in a somewhat quick but quite
penetrable fashion. Being clear about exactly when the physical
sensations are there will begin to clarify their slippery counterpart
that helps create the illusion of continuity or solidity: flickering
mental impressions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Coming directly
after a physical sensation arises and passes is a separate pulse of
reality that is the mental knowing of that physical sensation, here
referred to as “consciousness” (as contrasted with “awareness”
in Part III). By physical sensations I mean the five senses of touch,
taste, hearing, seeing, and smelling. This is the way the mind
operates on phenomena that are no longer there, even thoughts,
intentions and mental images.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Since I just used
this dangerous phrase “the mind,” I should quickly mention that
it cannot be found. I’m certainly not talking about the brain,
which we have never experienced, as the standard for insight
practices is what we can directly experience. As an old Zen monk once
said to us in his extremely thick Japanese accent, “Some people say
there is mind. I say there is no mind, but never mind. Heh, heh,
heh!”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, I will use
this dangerous phrase “the mind” often, or even worse “our
mind,” but think to yourself when you read it, “He’s just using
conventional language, but really there are just utterly transient
mental sensations. Truly, there is no stable entity called ‘the
mind’ which can be found! By doing insight practices, I will fully
understand this!” If you are able to do this, we’ll get along
just fine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This mental
impression of a previous sensation (often called “consciousness”
in Buddhist parlance) is like an echo, a resonance. The mind takes a
crude impression of the object, and that is what we can think about,
remember and process. Then there may be a thought or an image that
arises and passes, and then, if the mind is stable, another physical
pulse.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Each one of these
arises and vanishes completely before the other begins, so it is
extremely possible to sort out which is which with a stable mind
dedicated to consistent precision and to not being lost in stories.
<i>This</i> <i>means</i> <i>that</i> <i>the</i> <i>instant</i> <i>you</i>
<i>have</i> <i>experienced</i> <i>something</i>, <i>you</i> <i>know</i>
<i>that</i> <i>it</i> <i>isn't</i> <i>there</i> <i>any</i> <i>more</i>,
<i>and</i> <i>whatever</i> <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>is</i> <i>a</i>
<i>new</i> <i>sensation</i> <i>that</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> <i>gone</i>
<i>in</i> <i>an</i> <i>instant</i>. There are typically many other
impermanent sensations and impressions interspersed with these, but,
for the sake of practice, this is close enough to what is happening
to be a good working model.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Engage with the
preceding paragraphs. They are the stuff upon which great insight
practice is based. Given that you know sensations are vibrating,
pulsing in and out of reality, and that, for the sake of practice,
every sensation is followed directly by a mental impression, you now
know exactly what you are looking for. You have a clear standard. If
you are not experiencing it, then stabilize the mind further, and be
clearer about exactly when and where there are physical sensations.
Spend time with this, as long as it takes. The whole goal is to
experience impermanence directly, i.e. things flickering, and what
those things are doesn't actually matter one bit!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">How freeing!
Interpretation is particularly useless in insight meditation, so you
don't have to spend time doing it when you are on the cushion.
Throughout this book I recommend reflecting on spiritual teachings
and how to bring them to bear on our life, but not on the cushion.
Thoughts, even supposedly good ones, are just too slippery and
seductive most of the time, even for advanced meditators, though if
you can avoid getting lost in their content they are as valid a
stream of objects as any other. Try to limit yourself to a few
minutes of reflection per hour of meditation. This should be more
than enough. There are simply no substitutes for this sort of
momentum in practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">How fast are things
vibrating? How many sensations arise and vanish each second? This is
exactly what you are trying to experience, but some very general
guidelines can provide faith that it can be done and perhaps point
the way as well. Begin by assuming that we are talking about one to
ten times per second in the beginning. This is not actually that
fast. Try tapping five to ten times per second on a table or
something. It might take two hands, but it's manageable, isn't it?
You could obviously experience that, couldn't you? That's the spirit!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are faster and
slower vibrations that may show up, some very fast (maybe up to forty
times per second) and some very slow (that are actually made up of
faster vibrations), but let's just say that one to ten times per
second can sometimes be a useful guideline in the beginning. Once you
get the hang of it, the faster and slower vibrations are no big deal.
Alternately, depending on how you practice, conceiving of this as
like a shower of raindrops, a pointillist painting in motion, or 3D
TV snow might help. Reality is obviously quite rich and complex, and
thus the frequencies of the pulses of reality can be somewhat
chaotic, but they actually tend to be more regular than you might
expect. Also, there are not really any “magic frequencies.”
Whatever frequency or pulse or whatever you are experiencing at that
moment is the truth of that moment! However, in the beginning you
should go for faster vibrations over slower ones and then try for
wider ones over those that are narrower.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Don't worry if
things look or feel solid sometimes. Just be with the solidity
clearly and precisely, but not too tightly, and it can start to show
its impermanence. Be aware of each exact moment in which you
experience solidity and its beginning and ending. Remember that each
experience of solidity is a separate, impermanent sensation! Many
people begin practicing and really want to solidify something like
the breath so that they can actually pay attention to it. They become
frustrated when they have a hard time finding the breath or their
body or whatever. The reason they can’t find it is not because they
are a bad meditator but because they are having direct insight into
how things actually are! Unfortunately, their theory of what is
supposed to happen involves really perceiving something solid and
stable, so they get very frustrated. You should now be able to avoid
a lot of that frustration and begin to appreciate why knowing some
theory is important.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is also worth
noting here that the frequency or rate of these vibrations may change
often, either getting faster or slower, and that it is really worth
trying to see clearly the beginning and ending of each vibration or
pulse of reality. These are actually at least two different
sensations! It is also useful to check out exactly what happens at
the bottom, middle, and top of the breath if you are using the breath
as an object, and to examine if the frequency stays stable or changes
in each phase of the breath. Never assume that what you have
understood is the final answer! Be alert! Explore carefully and
precisely with openness and acceptance! This is the door to
understanding.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One last thing about
vibrations: looking into vibrations can be a lot like any other
sport. It can be thought of the way we might think of surfing or
playing tennis, and this sort of game-like attitude can actually help
a lot. We're “out to bust some vibrations!” as a friend of mine
enthusiastically put it. You don't know quite what the next return or
wave is going to be like, so pay attention, keep the mind on the
pulse of the sensations of your world just as you would on the wave
or ball, and keep playing!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I highly recommend
this sort of speed in practice not only because that is how fast we
have to perceive reality in order to awaken, but also because trying
to experience one to ten sensations per second is challenging and
engaging. Because it is challenging and engaging, we will be less
prone to getting lost in thoughts rather than doing insight
practices. Our minds have the power to perceive things extremely
quickly, and we actually use this power all the time to do such
things as read this book. You can probably read many words per
second. If you can do this, you can certainly do insight practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you can perceive
one sensation per second, try for two. If you can perceive two unique
sensations per second, try to perceive four. Keep increasing your
perceptual threshold in this way until the illusion of continuity
that binds you on the wheel of suffering shatters. <i>In</i> <i>short</i>,
<i>when</i> <i>doing</i> <i>insight</i> <i>practices</i>, <i>constantly</i>
<i>work</i> <i>to</i> <i>perceive</i> <i>sensations</i> <i>arise</i>
<i>and</i> <i>pass</i> <i>as</i> <u>quickly</u> <i>and</i> <i>accurately</i>
<i>as</i> <i>you</i> <i>possibly</i> <i>can</i>. With the spirit of a
racecar driver who is constantly aware of how fast the car can go and
still stay on the track, you are strongly advised to stay on the
cutting edge of your ability to see the impermanence of sensations
quickly and accurately.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will relate four
of the many little exercises that I sometimes do that I have found
useful for jump-starting and developing insight into impermanence.
They will demonstrate how we can be creative in exploring our reality
precisely but hopefully they will not be thought of in some sort of
dogmatic way. These objects and postures are not that important, but
understanding impermanence directly is.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In one of these
exercises, I sit quietly in a quiet place, close my eyes, put one
hand on each knee, and concentrate just on my two index fingers.
Basic dharma theory tells me that it is definitely not possible to
perceive both fingers simultaneously, so with this knowledge I try to
see in each instant which one of the two finger’s physical
sensations are being perceived. Once the mind has speeded up a bit
and yet become more stable, I try to perceive the arising and passing
of each of these sensations. I may do this for half an hour or an
hour, just staying with the sensations in my two fingers and
perceiving when each sensation is and isn’t there. This might sound
like a lot of work, and it definitely can be until the mind settles
into it. It really requires the concentration of a fast sport like
table tennis. This is such an engaging exercise and requires such
precision that it is easy not to be lost in thought if I am really
applying myself. I have found this to be a very useful practice for
developing concentration and debunking the illusion of continuity.
You can pick any two aspects of your experience for this exercise, be
they physical or mental. I generally use my fingers only because
through experimentation I have found that it is easy for me to
perceive the sensations that make them up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In another related
exercise, I do the same sort of thing, sitting quietly in a quiet
place with my eyes closed, but instead I concentrate on the
sensations of the front and back of my head. With the knowledge that
the illusion of a separate perceiver is partially supported by one
impermanent sensation incorrectly seeming to perceive another
impermanent sensation which it follows, such as the sensations in the
back of the head incorrectly seeming to perceive the sensations of
the front of the head which they follow, I try to be really clear
about these sensations and when they are and aren’t there. I try to
be clear if the sensations in the head are from the front or the back
of the head in each instant, and then try to experience clearly the
beginning and ending of each individual sensation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This practice also
requires a table tennis-like precision. Half an hour to an hour of
this can be quite a workout until the mind speeds up and becomes more
stable, but this sort of effort pays off. When I am engaged with this
practice, there is little room to be lost in thought. I have also
found this a very useful practice for developing concentration and
debunking the illusion of continuity and the illusion of a separate
self (more on that later).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In another exercise,
which is quite common to many meditation traditions, I sit quietly in
a quiet place, close my eyes, and concentrate on the breath. More
than just concentrating on it, I know that the sensations that make
up the concept “breath” are each impermanent, lasting only an
instant. With this knowledge, I try to see how many individual times
in each part of the breath I can perceive the sensations that make up
the breath. During the in-breath I try to experience it as many times
as possible, and try to be quite precise about exactly when the
in-breath begins and ends.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">More than this, I
try to perceive exactly and precisely when each sensation of motion
or physicality of the breath arises and passes. I then do the same
for the out-breath, paying particular attention to the exact end of
the out-breath and then the beginning of the new in-breath. I don’t
worry about how I am breathing because it is not the quality of the
breath which I am concerned with or even what the sensations are, but
the ultimate nature of these sensations: their impermanence, their
arising and passing away. When I am really engaged with bending the
mind to this exercise, there is little room to be lost in thought. I
have found this to be a very useful practice for developing
concentration and penetrating the illusion of continuity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the last
exercise, I take on the thoughts directly. I know that the sensations
that make up thoughts can reveal the truth of the Three
Characteristics to me, so I have no fear of them; instead I regard
them as more glorious opportunities for insight. Again, sitting
quietly in a quiet place with my eyes closed, I turn the mind to the
thought stream. However, rather than paying attention to the content
like I usually do, I pay attention to the ultimate nature of the
numerous sensations that make up thoughts: impermanence. I may even
make the thoughts in my head more and more intense just to get a good
look at them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is absolutely
essential to try to figure out how you experience thoughts, otherwise
you will simply flounder in content. What do thoughts feel like?
Where to they occur? How big are they? What do they look like, smell
like, taste like, sound like? How long do they last? Where are their
edges? Only take on this practice if you are willing to try to work
on this level, the level that tries to figure out what thoughts
actually are rather than what they mean or imply.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If my thoughts are
somewhat auditory, I begin by trying to perceive each syllable of the
current thought and then each syllable’s beginning and ending. If
they are somewhat visual, I try to perceive every instant in which a
mental image presents itself. If they seem somewhat physical, such as
the memory of a movement or feeling, I try to perceive exactly how
long each little sensation of this memory lasts. This sort of
investigation can actually be fairly easy to do and yet is quite
powerful. Things can also get a bit odd quickly when doing this sort
of practice, but I don’t worry about that. Sometimes thoughts can
begin to sound like the auditory strobing section of the song
“Crimson and Clover,” where it sounds like they are standing at a
spinning microphone. Sometimes the images in our head can begin to
flash and flicker. Sometimes our very sense of attention can begin to
strobe. This is the point! The sensations that imply a mind and
mental processes are discontinuous, impermanent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, this practice
requires steadiness and determination, as well as precision. When I
am really engaged with this, there is no time to be lost in the
content of the thoughts, as I am trying too hard to be clear about
the beginning and ending of each little flicker, squawk and pulse
which makes up thought. This can be an especially fun practice when
difficult thoughts are distracting me from a physical sensation. I
can turn on them, break them down into meaningless little blips,
little vibrations of suchness, and then they don’t have the power
to cause me any trouble. They just scatter like confetti. They are
seen as they are: small, quick and harmless. They have a message to
convey, but then they are gone.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When I am done with
this exercise, I return to physical objects and their arising and
passing. However, I have found taking on the sensations that make up
thoughts to be another very useful exercise for developing
concentration and penetrating the illusion of continuity. It doesn’t
matter if they are “good thoughts” or “bad thoughts,” as all
mental sensations are also dripping with ultimate truth that is just
waiting to be discovered, and thus I can proceed in my investigation
with confidence regardless of what arises. Whether our illusions are
penetrated using physical sensations or mental sensations is actually
completely irrelevant.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Hopefully these
exercises will give you some idea about how one might practice
understanding impermanence. Impermanence is a true mark of ultimate
reality, so just understanding this again and again can be sufficient
to drum it into our thick heads, debunk the illusion of continuity,
and once this is drummed into our thick heads we are free. This can
be a subtle business, so be patient and persevere. Remember all three
trainings. Following flickering sensations and understanding the
other two characteristics of suffering and no-self that they manifest
can be a powerful and direct cause for deep insights and awakenings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For five years of my
practice I was basically a One Technique Freak, and that technique
was noticing how sensations flicker. I would do it as often as I
could, i.e. basically whenever I didn’t have to be doing something
that required concentration on the specifics of my life. I would be
riding an elevator, just trying to see when I could feel each foot,
or lying down to sleep and noticing how many times I could experience
the sensations of my breath in each second. I also tried to notice
this aspect of things for every single sensation that occurred during
my formal practice. I used lots of objects, usually those that were
presenting strongly at that time, and would use some variations on
the above techniques as well as some others that I will mention
shortly to keep me from getting stuck, but the aspect of my world
that I tried to notice, things flickering, was always the same. I
found that by making this sort of commitment to understanding one of
the most basic assumptions of insight practices I was able to make
fast progress and gain the ultimate insights I was looking for.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5452_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_10"></a><a name="SUFFERING"></a>
SUFFERING</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The next
characteristic is <b>suffering</b> or <b>unsatisfactoriness</b>.
Sounds grim or pessimistic at first, and perhaps deservedly so in one
sense, but it is also a powerful statement that our moment-to-moment
experience will not permanently satisfy ever. It will never happen.
Why? Because everything is impermanent, that's one reason why! I just
said that nothing lasts, meaning that you can actually experience
everything that you normally think of as a solid world arising and
passing instant to instant. So what could last for even the blink of
an eye to satisfy? Nothing!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The point is not to
be a radical, pessimistic, nihilistic cynic. The point is that it is
not a thing that will help, but <i>an</i> <i>understanding</i> <i>of</i>
<i>something</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>relationship</i> <i>to</i>
<i>things</i>. There is no thought, mind state or whatever which will
do it. This is not to say that conventional day-to-day wisdom, such
as taking care of ourselves and others, isn't also quite important:
it very much is. Remember that awakening is not a thing or a mind
state or a thought, it is an understanding of perspective without
some separate thing that perceives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a great
relieving honesty in the truth of suffering. It can be very
validating of the actual experience of our life and also give us the
strength to look into the aspects of life that we typically try to
ignore and run from. Even some deep and useful insights can be
distinctly unpleasant, contrary to popular belief!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is more to
this truth, and it relates to the third characteristic, no-self. We
are caught up in this bizarre habit of assuming that there is an “I.”
Yet the definition of this seemingly permanent thing has to keep
constantly changing to keep up the illusion in an impermanent world.
This takes up a lot of mental time and is continually frustrating to
the mind, as it takes so much constant work and effort. This process
is called ignorance, i.e. the illusion of an “I” and thus that
everything else is “not I.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is the illusion
of duality, and the illusion of duality is inherently painful. There
is just something disconcerting about the way the mind must hold
itself and the information it must work to ignore in order to
&nbsp;maintain the sense that there is a permanent and continuous
self. Maintaining it is painful and its consequences for reactive
mind states are also painful. It is a subtle, chronic pain, like a
vague nausea. It is a distortion of perspective that we have grown so
used to that we hardly notice it most of the time. The suffering
caused by continually trying to prop up the illusion of duality is
<i>fundamental</i> <i>suffering</i>. <i>This</i> <i>definition</i> <i>of</i>
<i>suffering</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>one</i> <i>that</i> <i>is</i>
<i>most</i> <i>useful</i> <i>for</i> <i>insight</i> <i>practices</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To actually feel
moment to moment this quality of reality can be hard to do, not
because suffering is so hard to find (it has actually been said to be
the easiest of the three to tune into), but because it takes a
certain amount of bravery. Yet, it is so well worth it. If we finally
wake up to this quality of suffering we will effortlessly let it go,
drop it like a hot coal that we have finally realized we were
holding. It really works like that, and letting go in this way means
being free.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Investigate your
experience and see if you can be open to that fundamental, non-story
based aspect of your bare experience that is somehow unsettling,
unpleasant, or unsatisfactory. It can be found to some degree in
every instant regardless of whether it is pleasant, unpleasant or
neutral. Once you have some mental stability, you can even look into
the bare experience of the sensations that make up the stories that
spin in your mind and see how unsatisfactory and unsettling it is to
try to pretend they are a self or the property of some imagined self.
If we continue to habituate ourselves to this understanding moment to
moment we may get it into our thick heads and finally awaken.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My favorite exercise
for examining suffering is to sit in a quite place with my eyes
closed and examine the physical sensations that make up any sort of
desire, be it desire to get something, get away from something or
just tune out and go to sleep. At a rate of one to ten times per
second, I try to experience exactly how I know that I wish to do
something other than simply face my current experience as it is.
Moment to moment, I try to find those little uncomfortable urges and
tensions that try to prod my mind into fantasizing about past or
future or stopping my meditation entirely.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For that meditation
period, they are my prey and nourishment, opportunities to understand
something extraordinary about reality, and so I do my very best to
let none of them arise and pass without the basic sense of
dissatisfaction in them being clearly perceived as it is. I turn on
sensations of the desire to get results, turn on the pains and
unsettling sensations that make my mind contract, turn on the boredom
that is usually aversion to suffering in disguise, turn on the
sensations of restlessness that try to get me to stop meditating.
Anything with fear or judgment in it is my bread and butter for that
meditation period. Any sensation that smacks of grandiosity or
self-loathing is welcomed as a source of wisdom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A half hour to an
hour of this sort of consistent investigation of suffering is also
quite a workout, particularly as we spend most of our lives doing
anything but looking to these sorts of sensations to gain insight
from them. However, I have found that this sort of investigation pays
off in ways I could never have imagined.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Looking into
unsatisfactoriness may not sound as concrete as the thing about
vibrations, but I assure you it is. Even the most pleasant sensations
have a tinge of unsatisfactoriness to them, so look for it at the
level of bare experience. Pain is a gold mine for this. I am
absolutely not advocating cultivating pain, as there is already
enough there. Just knowing in each precise instant how you actually
know that pain is unsatisfactory can be profound practice. Don't
settle for just the knee jerk answer that “of course pain is
unsatisfactory.” Know exactly how you know this in each moment, but
don't get lost in stories about it. This is bare reality, ultimate
reality we're talking about. Just be with it, engage with it, and
know it as it is at a very simple level.</p>

NO-SELF</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The last and perhaps
most misunderstood of the Three Characteristics is <b>no</b>- <b>self</b>
, also rendered as <b>egolessness</b> or <b>emptiness</b> .
Emptiness, for all its mysterious sounding connotations, just means
that reality is empty of a permanent, separate self. <i>The</i>
<i>emphasis</i> <i>here</i> <i>absolutely</i> <i>must</i> <i>be</i>
<i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>words</i> “<i>permanent</i>” <i>and</i>
“<i>separate</i>.” It doesn't mean that reality is not there, or
that all of this is illusion! Solidity is an illusion, permanence is
an illusion, that the watcher is a separate thing is an illusion, but
all of this isn't an illusion. Sure, all experience is utterly
transient and ephemeral, but that is not quite the same as everything
being an illusion. There is a habit of reading just a bit too much
into things and coming out with the false conclusion that all of this
means that there is some separate, permanent us. Reality is actually
fine just as it is and always has been, but there is a deeper
understanding of it that is called for.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let's talk a little
bit about this concept and how the illusion of a self is created in
the first place before we talk about how to use this powerful and
profound concept of no-self in simple ways in practice. Some theory
really can be useful to the practice, as all of it can be understood
directly once one has some stability of mind and a bit of insight
into what is mind and what is body, and when each is and isn't there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We have this notion
that there is really a permanent “I.” We might say, “Hello, I
am...” and be quite convinced that we are talking about a
permanent, separate thing that can be found. However, if we are just
a bit more sophisticated we might ask, “What is this 'I' which we
are sure is us?” We have grown so accustomed to the fact of the
definition changing all the time that we hardly notice it, but the
point of insight practice is to notice it, and to see just what it is
that we are calling “I” in each moment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We may begin with
the obvious assumption: we are our body. This sounds nice until we
say something like “my body.” Well, if it is “my body,” that
seems to imply that, at that moment, whatever it is that owns the
body wasn't the body. Suppose someone points to our toenails. They
surely seem to be “me,” until we clip them, and then they are
“not me.” Is this really the same body as when we were born? It
isn't even made of the same cells, and yet it seems to be a permanent
thing. Look more closely, at the sensate level, and you will see that
moment to moment it isn't. At the level of actual experience, all
that is found is flickering stuff. So impermanence is closely related
to no-self, but there is more to no-self than that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Perhaps thoughts are
the “I.” They may seem more like the “true I” than the body
does. But they come and go to, don't they? Can we really control
these thoughts? Are they something solid enough to assume that they
are an “I”? Look closely and you will see that they are not. But
again, no-self is more profound than this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There also seems to
be something that is frequently called “the watcher,” that which
seems to be observing all this, and perhaps this is really the “I”
in question. Strangely, the watcher cannot be found, can it? It seems
to sometimes be our eyes, but sometimes not, sometimes it seems to be
images in our head and sometimes something that is separate from them
and yet watching the images in our head. Sometimes it seems to be our
body, but sometimes it seems to be watching our body. Isn’t it
strange how we are so used to this constant redefinition of ourselves
that we never stop to question it? Question it! This odd sense of an
unfindable watcher to which all of this is happening yet which is
seemingly separate from all that is happening, which sometimes seems
in control of “us” and yet which sometimes seems at the mercy of
reality: what is it really? What is going on here?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of my teachers
once wisely said, “If you are observing it, then it isn't you by
definition!” Notice that the whole of reality seems to be observed.
The hints don't get any better than this. Here are three more points
of theory that are very useful for insight practices and one’s
attempts to understand what is meant by no-self:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. There are
absolutely no sensations that can observe other sensations! (Notice
that reality is made entirely of sensations.)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. There are no
special sensations that are uniquely in control of other sensations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. There are no
sensations that are fundamentally split off from other sensations
occurring at that moment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To begin to unravel
this mystery is to begin to awaken. Simply put, reality with a sense
of a separate watcher is delusion, and unconditioned reality, reality
just as it is, is awakening.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Quick point here:
people can use the truth of no-self to rationalize all sorts of
strange behaviors because they misunderstand it as nihilism. “It's
all illusion anyway,” they might say. It absolutely isn't. All of
this can only be understood at the level that makes the difference by
simple, clear, precise practice, so just keep at it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One more related
thing here that is very important: ego is a process of
identification, not a thing in and of itself. It is like a bad habit,
but it doesn't exist as something that can be found. This is
important, as this bad habit can quickly co-opt the language of
egolessness and come up with phrases as absurd as: “I will destroy
my ego!” But, not being a thing, it cannot be destroyed, but by
understanding our bare experience, our minds, the process of
identification can stop. Any thoughts with “I,” “me,” “my”
and “mine” in them should be understood to be just thoughts which
come and go. This is not something you can talk yourself out of. You
have to perceive things as they are to stop this process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A commonly heard one
is, “I am always identifying with things, I am always attached to
things,” with the implication that there is actually someone who is
“bad” for “doing” this. Try to avoid this sort of story
making, this sort of unmindful mental spinning, but be kind to
yourself if it happens. The sensations that make up these thoughts
are just empty in the best of ways.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So who is it that
awakens? It is all of this transience which awakens, though for a
more mystical, thorough and seemingly ridiculous answer take a look
at No-self vs. True Self in Part III.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We don't have to
sort this all out at once. We can begin with simple steps and the
rest will fall into place if we are diligent and skillful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, now that I have
made the possible seem mystical and abstruse, hopefully I will make
it seem very attainable. The big, practical trick to understanding
egolessness is to tune into the fact that sensations arise on their
own in a natural causal fashion, even the intentions to do things.
This is a formal practice instruction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This may sound hard
until you think about it and then perhaps it may become so obvious it
may seem trite. But it isn't, and understanding it again and again,
moment to moment, can bang the truth into us, and if we fully get it
we will be free. So, start and perhaps remain with obvious things
like physical sensations. They just show up and check out over there,
don't they? Tune into this. Allow this quality of things arising and
passing on their own to show itself. Notice that whatever is observed
isn't “us.” Do this again and again and again at a rate of one to
ten times per second as before. That is all there is to it. See, that
wasn't so hard!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thoughts, the
breath, and all of our experience don't quite seem to be in our
control, do they? That's it! Know this moment to moment. Don't
struggle too much with reality, except to break the bad habits of
being lost in stories, poor concentration, and a lack of
understanding of the Three Characteristics. Allow vibrations to show
themselves and tune into the sense that you don't have to struggle
for them to arise. Reality just continues to change on its own.
That's really it. Investigate this again and again until you get it.
Notice that this applies to each and every sensation that you
experience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, while we can
direct the mind to penetrate into phenomena with great precision and
energy, we can also sit quietly and allow reality to just show itself
as it is. Both perspectives are important and valuable, and being
able to draw on each along the way can be very helpful. Said another
way, we can realize that reality is already showing itself, settle
quietly into this moment, and be clear and precise about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Obviously there is a
bit of a paradox here relating to effort and surrender. In many ways
it is at the heart of the spiritual life. There is a lot of advice
available on this point, but in terms of insight meditation practice
I would say this: If when meditating you can perceive the arising and
passing of phenomena clearly and consistently, that is enough effort,
so allow this to show itself naturally and surrender to it. If not,
or if you are lost in stories, then there are some teachings coming
up in the other lists that may help.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For day-to-day
reality, the specifics of our experience are certainly important, but
for insight into the truth of things in meditation they largely
aren't. Said another way, it is neither the object of meditation, the
causes of the object of meditation, nor the significance of the
object of meditation, but the truth of the sensations that make up
that “object” which must be understood. Once you can tell what is
mind and what is body, that's for the most part enough. So don't make
stories, but know this: things come and go, they don't satisfy, and
they ain't you. That is the truth. It is just that simple. If you can
just not get to caught up in the content and know these simple, basic
and obvious truths moment to moment, some other wordless and profound
understanding may arise on its own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A useful teaching is
conceptualizing reality as six sense doors: touch, taste, seeing,
hearing, smelling, and thought. It may seem odd to consider thought
as a sense door, but this is actually much more reasonable than the
assumption that thoughts are an “us” or “ours” or in complete
control. Just treat thoughts as more sensations coming in which must
be understood to be impermanent, unsatisfactory and not self. In this
strangely useful framework, there are not even ears, eyes, skin, a
nose, a tongue, or a mind. There are just sensations with various
qualities, some of which may imply these things for an instant.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Bare experience is
just dancing, flickering color, form, energy and space, basically,
and the knowledge of these (which is not as fundamentally different
from them as you might suspect). Try to stay close to that level when
you practice, the level of the simple, direct, obvious, literal. But
whenever you are lost in interpretation much beyond this, that ain't
insight meditation, as much as people would like it to be. Have I
said this enough? Okay, then.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I realize that most
people go into meditation looking for stability, happiness, and
comfort in the face of their own existence. I have just said that I
have spent many years cultivating extreme experiential instability,
careful awareness of the minutia of my suffering and the clear
perception that I don’t even exist as a separate entity. Why this
would be a good idea is a very complex topic that I will try to deal
with later, but I can honestly say that these practices are without
doubt the sanest thing I have ever done in my life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One more little
carrot: it is rightly said that to deeply understand any two of the
characteristics simultaneously is to understand the third, and this
understanding is sufficient to cause immediate first awakening.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5456_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_12"></a><a name="THE_FIVE_SPIRITUAL_FACULTIES"></a>
&nbsp;THE FIVE SPIRITUAL FACULTIES</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Five Spiritual
Faculties are said to be like a cart with four wheels and a driver.
If any of the four wheels is too small or wobbly or not in balance
with the others, then the going on the spiritual road will be rough.
If the driver is not paying attention then there will also be
problems. The four wheels symbolize <b>faith</b> , <b>wisdom</b> ,
<b>energy</b> and <b>concentration</b>. The driver symbolizes
<b>mindfulness</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is really a
useful little teaching and quite a fine list. The trick is that faith
and wisdom must both be made strong and kept in balance, as must
energy and concentration. Mindfulness may always be increased, so for
this one the sky is the limit, but don't be too obsessive about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This sounds really
simple and perhaps obvious, but there is quite a lot here, and on the
spiritual path it is worth checking up on ourselves regularly and
asking if the first four are all strong and in balance and if we
might be just a bit more mindful.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5458_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_13"></a><a name="FAITH_AND_WISDOM"></a>
FAITH AND WISDOM</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let's start with
<b>faith</b> and <b>wisdom</b> . Faith in deficiency can lead to
cynicism, giving up, half-hearted effort, and bitterness. Faith in
excess can lead to blind adherence to dogma, sectarian arrogance,
being disappointed when you realize that your teachers are human, an
inability to realistically examine and revise your approach to
spirituality when necessary, and many other problems. Wisdom in
deficiency can lead to stupidity, blindness, gullibility, and foolish
interpretations of the teachings. Wisdom in excess can lead to
harmful cleverness, vanity about one's insights, an overemphasis on
knowledge and study over practice and direct experience, and
desperate attempts to think yourself to enlightenment. (Note: Zen
koan training is something else entirely.)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You can see that an
excess of wisdom is similar to a lack of faith, and an excess of
faith is similar to a lack of wisdom. When this balance is right
there is a heartfelt steadiness, a quality of balanced and genuine
inquiry, an ability to persevere and yet a certain humility. Faith at
its best produces deep gratitude for life in all its richness, for
its lessons, difficulties and blessings, and for the chance to
awaken. Wisdom at its best comes from deep investigation of life as
it is and goes far beyond the reach of reason and rational thought,
transcending the paradoxes that these inevitably create. In the end,
wisdom and faith converge.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">How do we apply
this? Most of us will suffer from imbalances of wisdom or faith with
some regularity. So if things are going a bit off, just check in with
the Five Spiritual Faculties and ask, “Could I perhaps work a bit
on wisdom, faith, or bringing these into balance?” This is a
powerful question and, if we are willing to be honest with ourselves,
it can correct a lot of errors on the spiritual path. Another good
way to apply this is to look at the list of symptoms of imbalance
above and see if perhaps some of these apply to us. This is an easy
way to see what might need some attention.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5460_1179888903"></a><a name="ENERGY_AND_CONCENTRATION"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_14"></a>
ENERGY AND CONCENTRATION</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>Energy</b> and
<b>concentration</b> work just the same way: they must both be strong
but must also be in balance. When energy is deficient there is sloth,
torpor, dullness, and tiredness. When energy is in excess the mind
and body may be restless, jumpy, strained, and irritable. It may even
be unable to focus at all because so much emphasis is being placed on
effort itself. When concentration is deficient the mind won't stay
with an object and tends to get lost in thought. When concentration
is in excess one can get lost in one's objects or be focused too
narrowly and tightly for reality to “breathe.” Again, too much
energy is related to a lack of concentration and vice versa.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When this balance is
right, the posture is straight and steady but not rigid, and the mind
is bright and focused steadily on objects and their back and forth
interplay. When energy and concentration begin to come on line
without mindfulness being strong yet, the mind may be prone to
getting caught in obsessive thinking fueled by the strong energy and
concentration, so watch for this and stay grounded in physical
objects.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, simply pay
attention to how your practice is going and adjust the levels of
energy and concentration accordingly. Finding the balance takes time,
and may require regular readjustment as we learn to use the power of
our minds. Sometimes it is helpful to be very gentle with our
attention, as if we were trying to feel the wind on our skin from the
flapping of a nearby butterfly’s wings. Sometimes it is helpful to
use our attention like a machine gun. Often we do just fine somewhere
in between.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A willingness to
play around with various combinations of energy and concentration
produces the necessary personal experience to figure out what helps
and what is too much or too little. Many of the problems that
meditators come to ask meditation teachers about when they are doing
their practice relate directly to just balancing energy and
concentration, so engage with what that might mean and see if you can
apply this little teaching to help you see clearly.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5462_1179888903"></a><a name="MINDFULNESS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_15"></a>
MINDFULNESS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>Mindfulness</b>
is in a category all by itself, as it can balance and perfect all the
others. This does not mean that one shouldn't be informed by the
other two pairs, but that mindfulness is really, really important.
Mindfulness means knowing what is as it is right now. It is the
quality of mind that knows things as they are. If you are trying to
do this you are balancing energy and concentration, and also
balancing faith and wisdom. From energy the mind is alert and
attentive, from concentration it is stable. Faith here may also mean
acceptance, and wisdom here is clear comprehension.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Notice that this has
nothing do to with some sort of vague spacing out in which we wish
that reality would go away and our thoughts would never arise again.
I don't know where people get the idea that vague aversion to
experience and thought is related to insight practice, but it seems
to be a common one. Mindfulness is about being very clear about our
actual reality as it actually is. It is about being here now. The
ultimate truth is found in the ordinary sensations that make up our
world. If you are not mindful of them or reject them because you are
looking for “depth” and “transcendence,” then you will be
unable to appreciate what they have to teach and be unable to do
insight practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, if you know
things just as they are this is enough. We just keep coming back to
that one, don't we, but from lots of different angles. Each one of
these angles might be useful to you at different times, and having a
few little lists to look at as we walk our path can bring fresh
perspectives and keep us from getting stuck.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Five Spiritual
Faculties have also been presented in another order that can be
useful: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. In this
order, they apply to each of the Three Trainings. We have faith that
training in morality is a good idea and that we can do it, so we
exert energy to live up to a standard of clear and skillful living.
We realize that we must pay attention to our thoughts, words and
deeds in order to do this, so we try to be mindful of them. We
realize that we often fail to pay attention, so we try to increase
our ability to concentrate on how we live our life. In this way,
through experience, we become wiser in a relative sense, learning how
to live a good and useful life. Seeing our skill improve and the
benefits it has for our life, we generate more faith, and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We also may have
faith that we might be able to attain to high states of
consciousness, so we sit down on a cushion and energetically try to
stabilize our attention. We realize that if we are not paying
attention, being mindful, then this is impossible, so we work on
mindfulness of our object and of the qualities of the state we wish
to attain. We develop strong concentration on an object, stabilizing
more consistently. We attain to high states and thus gain an
understanding of how to navigate in that territory and the uses of
doing so. Our success creates more faith, and so we apply energy to
further develop our concentration abilities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We begin to think it
might be possible to awaken, we have faith, so we energetically
explore the sensations that make up our world without exception. With
an alert and energetic mind we explore this heart, mind and body just
as it is now with mindfulness. Reality becomes more and more
interesting, so our concentration grows, and this combination of the
first four produces fundamental wisdom. Wisdom leads to more faith,
and the cycle goes around again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The teaching of the
Five Spiritual Faculties has also been explored at great lengths in
many books, and there really is a lot to it. In its simple form you
can easily apply it, and it can really help sometimes. Balance and
strengthen. Strengthen and balance. These are the cycles we go
through with these faculties, and there is no limit to the level at
which they can be mastered.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One other thing is
accurately said of the Five Spiritual Faculties as they apply to
insight training: when they are balanced and perfected, this is
sufficient cause for awakening.</p>

6. THE SEVEN FACTORS OF ENLIGHTENMENT</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Seven Factors of
Enlightenment are <b>mindfulness</b>, <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b>
<b>the</b> <b>truth</b>, <b>energy</b>, <b>rapture</b>, <b>tranquility</b>,
<b>concentration</b> and <b>equanimity</b>. So, we have three
concepts from the Five Spiritual Faculties and four that seem new but
have actually already been touched on to some degree. The order here
is actually closely related to the stages of something called “The
Progress of Insight,” which is like a map of standard stages
through which diligent insight meditators pass in cycles. This
connection is a fairly advanced topic that will be explored later.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Seven Factors of
Enlightenment might be regarded as a pyramid with mindfulness as the
base and each factor supporting and helping create the other.
However, every factor is also important at every stage as well, so we
will look into each of these and see what they can tell us.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5466_1179888903"></a><a name="MINDFULNESS_2"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_17"></a>
MINDFULNESS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>Mindfulness</b>
has already been covered above, but in terms of practice I will say
that mindfulness can be really useful in sorting out what is mind and
what is body, as mentioned on the section on impermanence in the
Three Characteristics. You might want to read that one again, as it
is really relevant to practically applying these first two factors of
enlightenment. Basically, we need to know the basic sensations that
make up our world. This is the crucial foundation of insight
practices. Not surprisingly, the first classic insight that leads to
the others is called “Knowledge of Mind and Body” and arises when
we learn to clearly distinguish between the two as they occur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So with mindfulness
we sort out what is physical, what is visual, what is mental, what is
pleasant, what is unpleasant, what is neutral, and all of that. We
can know what is a mental sensation and what is a related physical
feeling. We can know what specific sensations make up our emotions.
We can know each thing and the mental impression of it that follows
it. We can know the intentions that precede actions and thoughts. We
can know where sensations are in relation to each other. We can know
exactly when they occur and how they change during their very brief
stay. We can and should sort these out as best we can. Be patient and
precise. Become fluent in the sensations that make up your reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While I have tried
to avoid advocating one specific insight tradition or technique over
any other, there is an exercise that you might find helpful when
trying to do this. It is commonly called “Noting,” and it has its
origins in the Pali Canon in Sutta #111, One by One as They Occurred,
of <u>The</u> <u>Middle</u> <u>Length</u> <u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Buddha</u> (very worthwhile reading). It is used
primarily in the Mahasi Sayadaw insight tradition from Burma, though
related exercises are found in various Zen traditions, notably Soto
Zen and Korean Chan, and probably in Tibetan Hinayana traditions as
well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Noting is the
practice that got me the most breaks and insights in my early
practice, particularly when coupled with retreats, and my enthusiasm
for it is understandably extreme. I still consider it the foundation
of my practice, the technique that I fall back on when things get
difficult or when I really want to push deep into new insight
territory. Thus, of all the techniques and emphases I mention in this
book, take this one the most seriously and give it the most
attention. Its simplicity belies its astonishing power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The practice is
this: make a quiet, mental one-word note of whatever you experience
in each moment. Try to stay with the sensations of breathing, noting
these quickly as “rising” (as many times as the sensations of the
breath rising are experienced) and then “falling” in the same
way. This could also be considered fundamental insight practice
instructions. When the mind wanders, notes might include “thinking,”
“feeling,” “pressure,” “tension,” “wandering,”
“anticipating,” “seeing,” “hearing,” “cold,” “hot,”
“pain,” “pleasure,” etc. Note these sensations one by one as
they occur and then return to the sensations of breathing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here are some
valuable tips for successful noting. Don’t get too neurotic about
whether or not you have exactly the correct word for what arises. The
noting should be as consistent and continuous as possible, perhaps
one to five times per second. Speed and an ability to keep noting no
matter what arises are very important. Anything that derails your
noting practice deserves aggressive and fearless noting the next time
it arises. Note honestly and precisely. So long as you note whatever
arises, you know that you were mindful of it. Noticing each sensation
and those that follow, you will see their true nature. Seeing their
true nature, you will gain profound insights.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What the sensations
are doesn't matter one bit from the point of view of noting practice.
What is important is that <i>you</i> <i>know</i> <i>what</i> <i>they</i>
<i>are</i>. The difference between these two perspectives should be
clearly understood. This practice is directly related to Koan
practices such as “what is it?” and is loosely related to
breathing exercises where you count breaths from 1 to 10.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of my very best
insight meditation teachers, a monk from Singapore, would hold
interviews every two days while I was on my third retreat. It was a
beautiful center in Penang, Malaysia that was very conducive to
practice. I would come in and describe all sorts of experiences that
I was all excited about, and he would simply listen calmly to me go
on and on and then finally ask, “Did you note it?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That was almost all
he ever said. It was amazing how easy it was to forget that simple
instruction, and equally amazing how extremely useful it was when I
remembered to follow it. He didn't seem to care about anything other
than that I get to know my reality as it was with great precision and
consistency. I knew very little theory then, but during those two
weeks I practiced noting quickly all day long and made the fastest
progress I have ever made in my life, getting all the way to the very
brink of first awakening in a mere 14-day retreat. Since that time, I
have been a big fan of this particularly direct and down-to-earth
method.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are many
techniques for waking up to the truth of our experience, of which
noting is just one. I have found it to be extremely powerful and
fast, but each person must find what works for them. The trick is to
get to know one's reality as it is, and what techniques one uses to
do this do not matter much so long as they work and bring results.
What is meant by “results” will be clearly spelled out in The
Progress of Insight in Part III.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5468_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_18"></a><a name="INVESTIGATION_OF_THE_TRUTH"></a>
INVESTIGATION OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Once we start to
know what our objects are, what our actual reality is, then we can
get down to the good stuff: knowing the truth of these things, called
appropriately <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b>
, also called investigation of the dharma. Dharma just means truth.
So, once mindfulness has made things a bit clearer we can know that
<i>things</i> <i>come</i> <i>and</i> <i>go</i>, <i>don't</i> <i>satisfy</i>
<i>and</i> <i>ain't</i> <i>us</i>. Hey, the Three Characteristics
again! They are the truth, the sooner we understand this the better,
and nothing helps us understand them like seeing them again and
again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Forgive this brief
digression, but I am no fan of the popular term “mindfulness
meditation,” as mindfulness is essential for both concentration
practices (which lead to temporary bliss states) and insight
practices (which lead to fundamental freedom). The crucial difference
between these meditation practices is that insight practices also
stress investigation of the Three Characteristics, whereas
concentration practices emphasize stabilizing in the illusion of
solidity and continuity while ignoring the fact that the sensations
that make up this are all impermanent, etc. Thus, I hope that one day
the modern meditation world drops this confusing term in favor of
more precise language.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In addition to the
categories of sensations mentioned above in Mindfulness, one could
also consider consistent investigation of all sensations that seem to
have to do with the direction and movement of attention, as well as
investigating all sensations that have to do with questioning,
wanting, the application of energy and even the individual sensations
that make up the process of investigation itself. These are very
interesting objects, as are “the hindrances.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Traditionally, books
on meditation spend a lot of time discussing the possible hindrances
to meditation. I will not. The hindrances are an important topic, but
they can easily begin to seem more ominous than they really are.
Hindrances are just anything of which we were not mindful and of
which we did not investigate the truth. Now that we know to be
mindful and investigate the Three Characteristics of all
moment-to-moment experiences, there will only be hindrances when we
forget to do this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If we do not forget
to do this, there will be no hindrances. No phenomena are inherently
a hindrance unless we do not understand them. If we did not
understand at least one of the Three Characteristics of each of the
sensations that make up a phenomenon, <i>no</i> <i>matter</i> <i>what</i>
<i>it</i> <i>was</i>, it was a hindrance. Remember that the content
of reality is not our concern in insight meditation, but the ultimate
truth of the sensations that make up experiential reality is. So
whatever seems to be in the way of your practice, remember that the
experience of that moment is the practice and contains all the truth
you could ever need! All phenomena are of the nature of ultimate
truth. When we know deeply that these are all of the nature of
ultimate truth, phenomena cease to be a fundamental problem.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Buddha was a
master of teaching through analogies that were easily accessible to
those listening to him. I am certainly not in his league in this
regard, and this will be clearly demonstrated by the analogy I am
about to use for investigation. However, it has its points, and so
after much consideration, I have included it here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Buddha gave his
analogies names, and I have named this one “The Analogy of Shootin’
Aliens.” Bear with me here! Just about all of us in this day and
age have at least seen if not played video games involving shooting
aliens. As the game goes on, the aliens come in faster and faster,
some taking multiple hits to kill them. Some of these games penalize
us for wasting ammunition, causing us to really focus on exactly
where and when these aliens are arising, so that we may shoot them
exactly when they arise as efficiently as possible before they shoot
us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A few of you may
already be thinking, “Get that bloody and violent analogy out of
this book of holy wisdom!” The Buddha used many similar analogies,
one of which comes to mind is has to do with a horse trainer
(teacher) who kills horses that simply will not be broken (stops
teaching unreachable students). Thus, you pansy critics can all drop
dead.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Anyway, in this
analogy the aliens are all of the little sensations that make up our
experience. Shooting them is paying attention to them and seeing
their true nature, perhaps with the aid of noting practice (like a
gun with laser sight on it). The aliens shooting us is what happens
when we do not see their true nature, as they become a hindrance,
binding us on the wheel of suffering for the duration of our
inability to shoot them. Some may even take us out of the game (cause
us stop practicing entirely). The aliens that take multiple hits to
kill are our big issues, those things that are difficult for us to
break into their composite sensations. Being penalized for shooting
wastefully is what can happen if we note sensations that we didn’t
actually experience because we fell into repetitive, imprecise,
mantra-like noting habits. Further, the speed, precision and playful
attitude required for video games is exactly like the feel of
well-done insight practices. If you watch some kid playing a fast
alien-shooting game, you will notice that they are really going for
it. They are shooting very fast and definitely not thinking about
anything but doing that. This is exactly the sort of dedication and
passion that helps with insight practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When our mindfulness
and investigation are on hair trigger, being aware of every little
sensation that arises and passes, we are bound to win sooner or
later. The motto, “Note first, ask questions later,” is just so
helpful if we are to keep practicing precisely without getting lost
in the stories. Again, off the cushion the stories can have some
value if not taken too seriously. On the cushion, take no prisoners:
“Note ‘em all, and let God sort ‘em out!” This is seemingly
extreme but actually very powerful and profound advice. Do not
dismiss easily The Analogy of Shootin’ Aliens.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Where the Analogy of
Shootin’ Aliens breaks down is that all these aliens want is
attention and acceptance. They come to us so that we will greet them
clearly and openly, but if we fail to do this they can get very
troublesome. Their little alien hearts are being broken when we don’t
get to know them as they are, so who can blame them when they get
mischievous and try to trick us into paying more attention to them by
causing trouble. Sure, it’s a bit childish of them, but we don’t
always get to meet mature and well-adjusted aliens.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, rather than
killing our aliens by shooting them, we give them what they want by
noticing or noting them. We don’t invite the pretty ones to stay
with us forever, nor do we ignore the boring aliens. We don’t kick
the ugly ones from our door either. Like a politician on the campaign
trail, we extend a hand to all, say, “Hello!” and then quickly do
this for lots of others. When we meet them, greet them, get to know,
accept and even love them, they go away happy. I realize that I’ve
just gone from being excessively violent to being excessively
sentimental, but somewhere in there is what insight practices are all
about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have already
mentioned numerous possible exercises, perspectives and emphases that
may be used when exploring our reality for the purpose of awakening,
and I will continue to mention more as we go along. However, I
recommend that the foundation of your practice be investigation of
the Three Characteristics of the sensations that make up your
reality. If you find it too complicated to try to investigate all
Three Characteristics at once, then I recommend quick and precise
investigation of impermanence. If this seems too difficult, I have
found the simple practice of noting very quickly to be more than
sufficiently powerful for gaining clear and direct insights into the
true nature of thing. Should you find that the numerous instructions
and avenues of inquiry I present to be too confusing, remember this
paragraph and stick to these simple but profound practices. “When
in doubt, note it out!”</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5470_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_19"></a><a name="ENERGY"></a>
ENERGY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, we diligently
investigate the ultimate truth of our experience, and this can
actually be really invigorating once we get into it. Just as playing
video games can be very exciting, we have lots of sensations coming
in all the time that are just screaming to be understood. When we
rise to this challenge, things can really begin to jump. Once we have
sorted out what is mind and what is body and begun to see a bit of
the Three Characteristics, this in itself can produce lots of <b>energy</b>,
the third of the seven factors. This can be just a bit scary at first
until we get used to how quick and powerful our minds can be. As
mentioned in the Five Spiritual Faculties, energy is a very good
thing, as it obviously energizes our practice. We can almost always
call up just a bit more energy when we need it, and this is a good
thing to realize. However, being mindful and investigating diligently
can also lead to increased energy, so now you have more than one way
to go about this! Thank you, Seven Factors of Enlightenment!</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5472_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_20"></a><a name="RAPTURE"></a>
RAPTURE</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When energy comes on
line with mindfulness and investigation, this can produce something
called <b>rapture</b> . Rapture has two general meanings, the first
of which relates to deep joy, pleasure, and enthusiasm. These are
valuable spiritual qualities, and Ye of Dark Puritanical Inklings
take heed of this! It is much easier going on the spiritual path if
we are generally enthusiastic about what we are doing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This should be no
surprise, but somehow it is often overlooked. I'm definitely not
advocating hedonistic Epicureanism here, but to walk the spiritual
path with a sense of joy, a sense of wonder, a bit of a smile and
<i>especially</i> <i>a</i> <i>sense</i> <i>of</i> <i>humor</i> is
really good for you and everyone who has to be near you. Sure, there
will be hard times and difficulties that can have good lessons to
teach us, but be open to what joy and happiness life can bring.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Spiritual practice
can also produce all kinds of odd experiences, some of which can be
very intense, bizarre and far out. This is the other connotation of
the word rapture, as these are commonly referred to as “raptures.”
Some of these might be really pleasant, some may just be weird, and
some might completely suck. All the strange physical sensations,
pains, pleasures, movements, visions, lights, perception distortions,
etc., which may or may not show up as a result of spiritual practice
are all just raptures. Repeat, just raptures. Don't get hung up on
them or make stories out of them, as compelling as they can be, and
don't think that they are required either: they aren't. The
sensations that make them up come, go, ain't you, and don't satisfy.
Most are just byproducts of meditation and strong concentration. Many
produce no wisdom. Some, of course, can provide deep insights into
the truth of things, but don't get stuck on these. Many of these
lessons show up once and never again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some people can get
so serious and fixated on suffering that they fight the pleasant
raptures and even cling to the difficult ones. Don't do this! The joy
and pleasure that may arise in meditation has wonderful healing
aspects to it, and it can lead to deep tranquility, concentration and
equanimity, which are all really good things. Don't cling to pleasant
states either, as you will just get stuck and be frustrated when they
end, which they always do. In general, if you try to fight or cling
to raptures you will get stuck, and if you can accept them as they
are this will be of benefit. See equanimity at the end of this list,
as well as the expertly written Chapter 9 of <u>A</u> <u>Path</u>
<u>with</u> <u>Heart</u> by Jack Kornfield.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is a good place
for me to mention the concept of <i>vedana</i>, which is a Pali word
that relates to the degree of pleasantness, unpleasantness or
neutrality of a sensation. If one pays too much exclusive attention
to sensations that are either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, while
ignoring the other sensations going on at that time, then one is
likely to be missing many opportunities for insight. Preoccupation
with pleasant sensations can cause one to become a vapid
bliss-junkie. Preoccupation with unpleasant sensations can cause one
to become dark and depressed. Preoccupation with neutral sensations
can cause one to become dull and emotionally flat. (Thanks to the
esteemed Christopher Titmuss for the inspiration for this paragraph).
Our experience tends to be a complex mixture of many flavors of
sensations. They are all quite worthy of investigation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The take-home
message here is that rapture and raptures are to be understood as
they are and related to wisely, accepting all sensations that make
them up, be they pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Learn when to put
the breaks on practice if the difficult raptures are teaching you
their important lessons a bit too fast for you to keep it together,
and learn how to open to the wonderful joy and bliss which spiritual
practice may sometimes produce.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5474_1179888903"></a><a name="TRANQUILITY"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_21"></a>
TRANQUILITY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Joy, bliss and
rapture can produce <b>tranquility</b> . We can associate being
peaceful with tranquility. Focusing on tranquility and a more
spacious and silent perspective in the face of difficult raptures can
help you ride them out, and just sitting silently and observing
reality do its thing can be very powerful practice. There are
actually whole schools of spiritual practice dedicated to this. Thus,
tranquility is a really good thing in meditation. We may think of
great spiritual masters being internally tranquil, and while it may
or may not be true, there are reasons why we associate tranquility
with spirituality. A mind that is not tranquil will have a harder
time concentrating and being balanced. It is just as simple as that.
Being kind and moral can help with tranquility, as this lessens the
harsh thought patterns in our minds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This does not mean
that non-tranquil moments are not “spiritual” or that we must
adopt some sort of restrained and artificial flatness. Remember, all
types of sensations, mind states and actions are valid phenomena for
investigation and real expressions of what is going on. Real
tranquility comes from a deep understanding of all of this, but all
too often this ideal becomes some sort of dehumanizing exercise in
passivity. Real tranquility often comes naturally, though it may be
skillfully cultivated as well. Cultivating equanimity of the kind
mentioned later is helpful for cultivating tranquility, as is
deepening in pure concentration practices, the second spiritual
training. Tranquility, concentration and equanimity are intimately
related.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5476_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_22"></a><a name="CONCENTRATION"></a>
CONCENTRATION</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><b>Concentration</b>
we have seen twice before, and we will see it again in much more
detail in Part III. One of the challenges of deep tranquility is
keeping the mind concentrated. This may seem like a direct
contradiction to what I have just said, but there may be stages of
practice where there can be so much tranquility that the mind can get
quite dull and hard to focus. So, just as tranquility is good for
concentration and acceptance, too much is similar to not having
enough energy. Remember, balance and strengthen, strengthen and
balance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As these are the
Seven Factors of Enlightenment, they apply directly to insight
practices, training in wisdom. Thus, the concentration being referred
to here is a very different kind of concentration than that used for
attaining high concentration states. It is called “momentary
concentration.” In the context of insight, concentration really
means that we are able to very consistently investigate each
sensation that arises, one after the other. In this way, we have
stability of our ability to investigate, in that it can happen again
and again without interruption, but we are not trying to attain
stable states or anything else, as we are doing insight practices.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5478_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_23"></a><a name="EQUANIMITY"></a>
EQUANIMITY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As mentioned before,
concentration can produce great stability of mind, and this can lead
to <b>equanimity</b> . Equanimity is that quality of mind that is
okay with things, or balanced in the face of anything, even a lack of
equanimity. This may sound a bit strange, but it is well worth
considering. Equanimity also relates to a lack of struggle even when
struggling, to effortlessness even in effort, to peacefulness even
when there is not tranquility. When equanimity is really well
developed, one is not frightened of being afraid, worried by being
concerned, irritated by being irritated, pissed off at being angry,
etc. The fundamental nature of the mind is imperturbable and
absolutely equanimous; phenomena do not disturb space or even
fundamentally disturb themselves from a certain point of view. There
are actually whole spiritual traditions that involve just tuning into
this basic truth. There can be great value in learning to see the
space around things, rather than just being caught up in the things
themselves. A useful phrase from one of these traditions is
“cultivating space-like meditative equipoise.” The more we
habituate this way of being, the more we connect with the truth of
our minds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are also some
really excellent teachings, especially from Zen and Daoism (also
spelled Taoism), that relate to this, such as the teachings about no
defilements, no enlightenment (or practice is enlightenment), nothing
to perfect, no where to go, etc., and checking in with some of these
teachings can be very helpful. This is the important counterbalance
to spiritual striving and gung-ho practice that can get very
future-oriented if done incorrectly. In the end, even if you have all
kinds of insights, if you don't have equanimity, you will be beating
your head against a wall, and it actually might feel like that or
worse.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Once again we are
back to knowing this moment just as it is. This “just as it is”
quality is related to mindfulness and also to equanimity. In the end,
we have to just accept the truth of our lives, of our minds, of our
neuroses, of our defilements, of impermanence, of suffering, and of
egolessness. We have to accept this, and this is what they are
talking about when they say “just open to it,” “just be with
it,” “just let it be,” “just let it go,” and all of that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">From a pure insight
practice point of view, you can’t ever fundamentally “let go”
of anything, so I sometimes wish the popularity of this misleading
and indifference-producing admonition would decline, or at least be
properly explained. However, if you simply investigate the truth of
the Three Characteristics of the sensations that seemed to be a solid
thing, you will come to the wondrous realization that reality is
continually “letting go” of itself! Thus, “let it go” at its
best actually means, “don’t give a bunch of transient sensations
an excessive sense of solidity.” It does not mean, “stop feeling
or caring,” nor does it mean, “pretend that the noise in your
mind is not there.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If people start with
“just open to it” and yet don't develop strong mindfulness, look
into the Three Characteristics and gain deep insights, then their
practice may be less like meditation and a lot more like
psychotherapy, day dreaming, or even self-absorbed, spiritually-
rationalized, neurotic indulgence in mind noise. It was noticing the
high prevalence of this activity and the pervasive and absurd notion
that there was no point in trying to get enlightened that largely
demolished my vision of being a happy meditation teacher in some
mainstream meditation center somewhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Psychotherapy, on
the other hand, can be a fine undertaking, but it is a completely
different endeavor from meditation and falls squarely in the domain
of the first training. I do not, however, advocate wallowing in
self-absorbed mind noise, and anyone who has been to a small group
meeting on a meditation retreat knows what I am talking about. This
is what happens when people don’t ground the mind in the object of
meditation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
even if you gain all kinds of strong concentration, look deeply into
impermanence, suffering and no-self, but can't just open to these
things, can't just let them be, can't accept the sometimes absurd and
frightening truths of your experience, then you will likely be stuck
in hell until you can, particularly in the higher stages of insight
practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Reflect on these
previous three paragraphs now and often, as many, many errors on the
spiritual path come from not understanding the points made therein.
Too often there is an imbalance between the first three (mindfulness,
investigation, and energy), and the last three (tranquility,
concentration and equanimity). The vast majority of aspiring insight
meditators are, to be honest, way, way, way too slack about the first
three. Just so, some gung-ho meditators get into trouble when they
don't cultivate enough acceptance, balance and peace, related to the
second three. When people focus only on the middle factor, rapture,
they become vapid bliss-junkies. In short, all seven factors are very
important.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The order here is
important. Start with good technique, mindfulness, investigation,
etc., and work on the others along the way. In summary, you must have
both insights and acceptance, and each perspective can and should
help the other along the way. They are actually one and the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One last thing about
equanimity: its near enemy, its deadening imposter, is indifference.
<i>Real</i> <i>equanimity</i> <i>is</i> <i>accepting</i> <i>of</i>
<i>the</i> <i>full</i> <i>range</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>heart</i>
<i>and</i> <i>experience</i>, whereas indifference is dry, flat and
heartless. This point is frequently misunderstood. However, being
accepting of the full range of the heart doesn't mean always acting
on whatever impulse comes up. Act only on the impulses of the heart
that seem skillful and kind.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To balance and
perfect the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, you guessed it, is
sufficient cause for awakening. Thus, checking in from time to time
with this little list and seeing how you are doing and what might
need some improvement is a good idea, and just having this list in
the back of your mind somewhere can be helpful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is important to
note that only one factor, investigation of the Three
Characteristics, separates training in concentration from training in
fundamental insight. When purposefully training in concentration, we
decide to be mindful of a limited and specific concentration object,
such as the breath or even a rarified state of consciousness. We do
not, however, investigate the individual sensations that make up that
state, as it would break apart under that investigation and produce
insights. If we are not looking for ultimate insights at that point
in time, then we should avoid investigating that state. However, we
do apply energy to stabilize our concentration, and this produces
rapture, a characteristic of the early concentration states. We also
cultivate concentration very strongly, obviously, and also
tranquility and equanimity, which help us stabilize early states and
attain to higher ones. Thus, six of the Seven Factors of
Enlightenment are cultivated by training in concentration, and it is
often recommended as a preliminary training before training in
insight for this and other reasons.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Training in morality
also cultivates some of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, though in
a less formally meditative way. In order to work well in the ordinary
world, it is very helpful to be mindful of what we are doing, saying
and thinking and also what effects these produce in the world so that
we can consciously work to craft the life we want to lead as best we
can. It is helpful to exert energy as we craft our life for obvious
reasons. We can also cultivate tranquility, the ability to not take
life too seriously, to relax, finding that balance of focus and ease
that makes for a good life. We can learn to concentrate on staying on
track with our tasks, goals and aspirations, though in this case
concentration is more like a form of discipline than the
concentration of formal meditation, though discipline of action,
speech and mind is vital for the other two trainings. Finally, we can
learn that we cannot get rid of all of the bumps on our road, so
having the shock absorbers of equanimity, the ability to stay
spacious and accepting of what happens, is also very helpful for
crafting a good and healthy life.</p>

7. THE THREE TRAININGS REVISITED</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Three Trainings
provide a great framework for thinking about spiritual work, a
framework that can help us maintain a clear and empowering way of
thinking about what we are doing. In this chapter, I will discuss
many important aspects of the spiritual path and use the Three
Trainings, actually the scope of each of the Three Trainings, to
provide an easy and powerful way of dealing with these complex
topics.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just to review, the
scope of the first training, which I call morality, is the ordinary
world, the conventional world, the world that we are all familiar
with before we even consider more specialized topics such as
meditation. The goal is to act, speak and think in ways that are
conducive to the welfare of yourself and others. The scope of the
second training, concentration or depths of meditation, is to focus
on very specific and limited objects of meditation and thus attain to
specific altered states of consciousness. The scope of the third
training, that of insight or wisdom, is to shift to perceiving
reality at the level of individual sensations, perceive the Three
Characteristics of them, and thus attain to profound insights into
the nature of reality and thus realize stages of enlightenment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First, I will
consider happiness in the context of scopes of the Three Trainings.
As training in morality is such a vast subject, the ways we can find
happiness is also a vast subject, and becomes interesting primarily
in comparison to the other two training’s scopes, those of
concentration and wisdom. The common denominator of the concentration
attainments is that we learn to get ourselves into states of
consciousness that are some mixture of blissful and peaceful, as well
as increasingly spacious and removed from our ordinary experience.
These can be a source of happiness that is far more intense and
reliable than the happiness found in the ordinary world. Being able
to access as much happiness and peace as we wish when we wish reduces
our anger at the world from not providing us with these, making us
less needy and greedy. There is also the happiness that comes from
seeing the true nature of the sensations that make up our world and
thus attaining to stages of realization or enlightenment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are three
areas of renunciation that correspond to the scopes of the Three
Trainings. We can renounce aspects of the ordinary world by simply
abandoning these things. We can quit our job, leave our relationship,
stop smoking crack, and shave our heads. We can try to be less angry
or fearful. We can work on our communication skills, trying to avoid
lying and slander. Some of these may be easier than others, and some
of these may be helpful and some not, but the important point here is
that these sorts of forms of renunciation are, for better or for
worse, renunciation of aspects of the ordinary world within the
context of the first training’s scope. Or, we can renounce
renouncing these things and do them. Renunciation is a very arbitrary
concept when applied to the first training.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is also the
renunciation that comes from being willing and able to attain the
temporary concentration attainments. We are willing to spend some
time removed from the ordinary experience of the world and enter into
states where the ordinary world becomes more and more removed from
us. It is usually not that hard to convince people that there may be
occasions when having the ability to renounce the ordinary world in
this way for some period of time could be advantageous. We can all
imagine taking a little bliss break and finding it helpful in some
appropriate context.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is also the
type of renunciation associated with insight practices, in which one
is willing to break from the gross conceptual way of working that is
helpful for the scope of the ordinary world, break from the more
restricted and refined conceptual way of working that is necessary to
attain stable altered states of consciousness, and move to perceiving
sensations individually and directly, seeing the true nature of them.
This is a much more subtle and sophisticated form of renunciation
than the other two, and it is not always easy to convince people that
having this option open to them is a good idea.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While
“enlightenment” generally sounds very appealing, it suddenly
sounds strange in the context of seeing all sensations as being
utterly transient, a source of pain if we make artificial dualities
out of them, and not self. People often mix up the three kinds of
renunciation, the most common error being that they imagine that they
must “give up” aspects of the first two trainings (a happy life
and fun concentration states) in order to renounce them in the
insight way, in which they see the true nature of the sensations that
make up these things. They imagine that they must give up their job
or relationship in order to see its true nature, or imagine that they
must not enter into high states to see their true nature. This basic
conceptual error causes many of the problems that people find on the
spiritual path. That brings me to the three forms of suffering.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First, there is the
form of suffering that the Buddha is most famous for talking about,
ordinary suffering, the standard list including such things as birth,
sickness, old age, death, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. These
are ordinary forms of suffering that we can try to mitigate as best
we can by ordinary methods, i.e. by working within the scope of the
first training, i.e. the conventional world. I am a big fan of trying
to find worldly happiness so long as we do not neglect the importance
of the other two trainings. There is also the form of suffering
relating to the scope of the second training that comes from being
limited to our ordinary state of consciousness, with our only way out
coming from sleep or the use of chemical substances. We yearn for
bliss that is not so bound up in things like whether or not we get a
good job, for experiences like those found in the concentration
states. Our minds have this potential, and the failure to be able to
access these states at times when doing so would be helpful and
healthy is a source of bondage. I am a big fan of being able to
attain these wonderful states so long as we do not neglect the other
two trainings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is also the
kind of suffering that comes from making artificial dualities out of
non-dual sensations, and all of the unnecessary reactivity,
misperceptions, distortions of perspective and proportion, and basic
blindfulness that accompanies that process. This kind of suffering,
relating to the scope of training in wisdom, is not touched by the
first two trainings, and thus forms a background level of suffering
in our life and also increases the potential for further suffering in
the other two scopes. This form of suffering is gradually relieved by
the stages of enlightenment, as fewer and fewer aspects of reality
have the capacity to trick the mind in this way. I am a big fan of
awakening and thus eliminating this pervasive form of suffering, just
as long as we do not also neglect the other two trainings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The suffering of the
ordinary world can be extremely unpredictable, and working to relieve
it is a very complex business, the work of a lifetime and perhaps an
eternity. The suffering related to being unable to access refined
altered states of consciousness is mitigated by simply taking the
time to learn the skills necessary and then refining them until they
are accessible to us when we wish. There are limits to these states,
and so the basic states attainable by training in concentration can
be very thoroughly mastered within a lifetime and even within a few
years or perhaps months for those with talent and diligence. The
stages of enlightenment are permanent, and once they are attained,
that aspect of our suffering is forever eliminated and never arises
again. This can be accomplished by those who take the time to learn
the skills necessary to see individual sensations clearly and are
willing to work on that level.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These basic facts
can be used to help us plan our quest for happiness and the
elimination of the various forms of suffering in our life. We can
direct our studies, our training, and work on specific skills that
lead to specific effects and abilities in the order we choose, within
the limits of our life circumstances and the resources available to
us. For instance, it might make sense to learn concentration skills
early in our life, as they cultivate so many of the skills necessary
for the other two trainings and can provide increased sense of ease
and wellbeing. For example, rather than popping a cold beer at the
end of a hard day, we could bathe our body and mind in as much bliss
and peace as we can stand for as long as we wish. If we master
concentration practices, we have the option to make such choices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It might also make
sense to work on insight practices early rather than later so as to
reduce the amount of time during our life that we live with the
fundamental suffering caused by the illusion of duality. There is
only so much we can do to prevent ordinary suffering for ourselves
and others, though it is always good to do what we can. Thus, it is
also good to realize that we can also reduce and eliminate the other
forms of suffering through learning the two basic styles of
meditation more easily than we can eliminate much of our conventional
suffering.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are three ways
in which words such as “enlightenment” are used, and these may
also relate to the scopes of the Three Trainings. However, I feel
that this is a dangerous habit, and I strongly advocate using
enlightenment and similar words to refer only to ultimate insights,
meaning the stages of awakening in the high and traditional sense.
While we may hear people speak of committing “enlightened”
actions, or of thinking in “enlightened” ways, I have come to the
conclusion that for spiritual training we either need to be very
careful to explain that these are very conventional and relative
definitions of enlightenment or not use such language at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some traditions give
some of the very high concentration states an ultimate status. I also
advocate strongly against this, as did the Buddha. These states are
so compelling and seductive for some people that they imagine they
are enlightened in the non-dual sense when they are merely having
temporary unitive or unknowing experiences (experiences where reality
did something that was sufficiently lacking in specific qualities or
intensity to be clearly known). Thus, I strongly suggest that such
attainments never be associated with the language of enlightenment in
any way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, I define
enlightenment as permanently eliminating the basic perceptions that
either duality or unity is the answer, and thus attaining to
permanent non-dual realizations that are unshakable. It has nothing
whatsoever to do with how things manifest and everything to do with
some basic understanding of those things. I devote an entire chapter
to explaining this more fully, but it is important for the discussion
in between here and there to have been introduced to the strict and
formal definition of enlightenment that I will be using.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These frameworks can
also be useful for looking at other common issues such as thoughts of
past and future that people run into when they get into meditation.
Confusion arises when these pieces of advice are applied outside of
the scope for which they were meant.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When working on our
ordinary lives, i.e. within the scope of the first training, the
content of our thoughts on past and future is very helpful, in fact
absolutely necessary. With experience we generate a body of memory of
what leads to what in this world, and with our predictive ability we
can use this to try to craft a well-lived life, however we define
that. However, when working on training in concentration, such
thoughts are generally ignored or suppressed by deep concentration on
another object. When doing insight practices, it doesn’t matter so
much if thoughts of past or future arise, so long as we ignore their
content, notice that they occur now, and notice the true nature of
the individual sensations that make up those thoughts. It is common
to hear of people trying to apply one piece of advice to a scope for
which it was never intended, like trying to stop thinking when trying
to deal with their daily life. This sort of practice would simply
promote stupidity, and there is already more than enough of that. In
short, when evaluating or applying a piece of spiritual advice, make
sure you understand the specific context for which it was designed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I thought it would
be fun to envision the Three Trainings as characters and have them
critique each other and then talk with each other about ways that
they could reinforce each other. I will do this in the form of a
short play in one act. While I will exaggerate and dichotomize their
issues with each other for comic effect, I do think that each of the
points made has some validity. Hopefully, you will see through the
humor to the important points being illustrated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Curtain opens.
Morality, Concentration and Insight are sitting in a bar having a
discussion. A large stack of empty shot glasses sits in front of each
character.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: You navel
gazing, self-absorbed, good-for-nothing freaks! I go out and work
hard all day long to make this world fit to live in while you two sit
on those sweat covered cushions and cultivate butt-rot! I go out and
make good money, keep food in our mouths, a roof over our heads, deal
with our stuff, and you go out and spend our money up at that
freak-house you call a meditation center when there is important work
to be done! I want to work on my tan!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight: Who are you
calling “self-absorbed?” I can’t be self absorbed by
definition! If it wasn’t for me, you would be so stuck in dualistic
illusion that you wouldn’t know your ass from your elbow, you
conceptually fixated, emotionally mired,
bound-up-in-manifestation-looking, twelve sandwich eating...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Concentration: Yeah!
And by the way, Mr. Oh-so-worldly, you should learn to lighten up
sometimes! Work your fingers to the bone, whaddaya get? Bony fingers.
That’s what. And that goes for you too, Mr. Enlightenment! If you
didn’t have my skills, you’d be shit out of luck, unable to
focus, and dead boring to boot! Who brings up the deep joy and
wondrous mind states around here? I do, that’s who, so you two
should just shut up! Insight: Oh, yeah? Well, Mr. La-la Land, if it
weren’t for me, we’d be so caught up in your transient highs that
we might just get arrested. Somebody call the law! You two are so
easily sucked into blowing things out of proportion that without me
you two would have all the perspective of a dung heap!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: Dung heap?
You’d be lucky to have a dung heap if it wasn’t for me, you
emptiness-fixated, <i>I’m</i>-<i>oh</i>-<i>so</i>-<i>non</i>-<i>conceptual</i>
vibration-junkie. What good is having perspective if you don’t go
out and use it?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Concentration: Yeah!
And speaking of perspective, I give you guys more perspective than
you have any idea of. Not only do I provide a bridge between our
resident Save-the-world Poster Child and the Void-fixated
Flicker-boy, I help you two <i>get</i> <i>your</i> <i>twitchy</i>
<i>little</i> <i>minds</i> <i>right</i>! I help the Boy Scout here
gain more and deeper insights into his screwed up emotional world and
“stuff” than he ever could have on his own, and if it wasn’t
for me, Mr. Ultimate would just be spinning his wheels in the parking
lot! And further more, I am fun, fun, fun!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight: Yeah,
maybe, but you don’t know when to stop, you otherworldly
space-case! If Relative Man and I hadn’t pulled you out of the
clouds, you’d still be lost in some formless realm thinking you had
half a clue. I’m the one with the clue! There ain’t nothin’ in
the world like what I know, and without it, you two’s whole
pathetic little sense of identity would be bound up in a world beyond
your control. I am your salvation, and you know it!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: Beyond my
control my ass! I make things happen in this world, great things! I’m
the one that really gets us somewhere! I make a difference! Who cares
if there is no self when people are starving in Africa?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight: Who cares
is exactly my point! There is no separate, permanent self that cares!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: “I know
you are, but what am I?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight: Exactly!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: Jerk!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Concentration: See?
You guys gotta' chill out, get some balance and peace in your life.
Take a few moments and just breathe! Leave your worries and cares
behind, and fly the friendly skies! It’s free, legal, and
oh-so-recommended. You can quit whenever you like! All your friends
are doing it! Come on, just relax!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: All right,
Fly Guy, when are we going to deal with our emotional issues, huh?
When are we going to save the world? We can’t just go on vacation
forever.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight: Your
problem is that you can’t see the sensations that make up these
“issues” as they really are, so you make such a big friggin’
deal out of them. I mean, I see your point, but you are so reactive
and blind that you are hardly the one for the job. You solidify these
things into huge monsters, forget you have done this, and then freak
out when they come running after you. You need a clue, you confused
little shrew!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: Oh, yeah!
Don’t think that just because you can see the true nature of the
issues that make up your reality that you won’t still have stuff to
deal with! Now, that’s delusion!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight: It’s even
more deluded to think that you can really have a completely healthy
perspective on anything without me, you Monster Maker!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Concentration: Dude,
do you see those angels floating through the wall?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: Where in
the Hell did I find you freaks?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight: Short
memory, eh? You found us when you realized you couldn’t do it on
your own. You needed us to really be able to do the job you wanted to
do, to really make a difference and be as happy and effective as you
could be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality: Yeah? And
when can I get rid of you?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Concentration and
Insight: When you have mastered us completely. Jinx, one two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Morality:
Bartender...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">THE END.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you find that you
have gotten to the point when you cannot laugh at your own path, stop
immediately and figure out why. I hope you have found this little,
irreverent dialogue entertaining. While obviously a bit ridiculous,
these sorts of tensions can arise until we really have a solid grasp
of each training. When we have this, they will work together as they
were meant to.</p>

&nbsp;8. THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Four Noble
Truths, <b>suffering</b>, <b>its</b> <b>cause</b> , <b>its</b> <b>end</b>
, and <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>that</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b>
<b>end</b> , are fundamental to the teachings of the Buddha. He was
fond of summarizing his whole teaching in terms of them. Actually,
when asked to be really concise, he would just say the first and
third: suffering and the end of suffering. This was what he taught.
Like the other little lists here, they have great profundity on many
levels and are worth exploring in depth.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5484_1179888903"></a><a name="TRUTH_NUMBER_ONE__SUFFERING"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_26"></a>
TRUTH NUMBER ONE: SUFFERING</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first truth is
the truth of <b>suffering</b>. Hey, didn't we just see that in the
Three Characteristics? Yes! Isn't that great! We also just saw it in
The Three Trainings Revisited. There must have been something
important about it for it to start off something called the Four
Noble Truths that is not immediately obvious. Why do we practice?
Suffering, that's why! It is just that simple. Why do we do anything?
Suffering!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Plenty of people
balk at this, and say that they do lots of things because of reasons
other than suffering. I suppose that to be really correct I should
add in ignorance and habit, but these are intimately connected to
suffering. This is worth investigating in depth. Perhaps there is
something more to this first truth that they may have missed on first
inspection, as it is a deep and subtle teaching. Actually, to
understand this first truth is to understand the whole of the
spiritual path, so take the time to investigate it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The basic gist of
the truth from a relative point of view is that we want things to be
other than they are, and this causes pain. We want things that are
nice to be permanent, we want to get what we want and avoid what we
don't want. We wish bad things would go faster than they do, and
these are all contrary to reality. We all die, get sick, have
conflicts, and constantly seem to be running around either trying to
get something (greed), get away from something (hatred), or tune out
from reality all together (delusion). We are never perfectly happy
with things just as they are. These are the traditional, relative
ways in which suffering is explained, but these definitions can only
take us so far.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">At the most
fundamental level, the level that is the most useful for doing
insight practices, we wish desperately that there was some separate,
permanent self, and we spend huge amounts of time doing our best to
prop up this illusion. In order to do this, we habitually ignore lots
of useful information about our reality and give our mental
impressions and simplifications of reality much more importance than
they are necessarily due. It is this illusion that adds a problematic
element to the normal and understandable ways in which we go about
trying to be happy. We constantly struggle with reality because we
misunderstand it, i.e. because reality misunderstands itself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“So what's new?”
one might say. Good point! It isn't new, is it? This has been the
whole of our life! The big question is “Is there some understanding
which makes a difference?” Yes, or we wouldn't be bothering with
all of this spirituality stuff. Somewhere down in our being there is
a little voice that cries, “There is another way!” We can find
this other way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Connecting with the
truth of suffering can actually be very motivating for spiritual
practice. Most traditional talks on the Buddha's teachings begin with
this. More than just being motivating for spiritual practice, tuning
into suffering is spiritual practice! Many people start meditating
and then get frustrated with how much suffering and pain they
experience, never knowing that they are actually starting to
understand something. They cling to the ideal that insight practices
will produce peace and bliss and yet much of what they find is
suffering. They don’t realize that things on the cushion tend to
get worse before they get better. Thus, they reject the very truths
they must deeply understand to obtain the peace they were looking for
and thus get nowhere. They reject their own valid insights that they
have obtained through valid practice. I suspect that this is one of
the greatest and most common stumbling blocks on the spiritual path.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a flip side
to suffering which can help, and that is compassion, the wish for
there to not be suffering. Wherever there is suffering there is
compassion, though most of the time somewhat twisted by the confused
logic of the process of ego. More on this in a bit, but it leads
directly to the second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering.

<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5486_1179888903"></a><a name="TRUTH_NUMBER_TWO___DESIRE"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_27"></a>
TRUTH NUMBER TWO: “DESIRE”</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Second Noble
Truth is that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>is</b>
<b>desire</b> , also rendered as craving or attachment. We want
things to be other than they are because we perceive the world
through the odd logic of the process of ego, through the illusion of
the split of the perceiver and the perceived. We might say, “Of
course we want things to be great and not unpleasant! What do you
expect?” The problem isn't actually quite in the desire for things
to be good and not be bad in the way that we might think; it is, in
fact, just a bit subtler than that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is a really
slippery business, and many people can get all into craving for
non-craving and desiring non-attachment. This can be useful if it is
done wisely and it is actually all we have to work with. If common
sense is ignored, however, desiring non-attachment may produce
neurotic, self-righteous, repressed ascetics instead of balanced,
kind meditators. A tour of any monastery or spiritual community will
likely expose you to clear examples of both sides of this delicate
balance. So, don't make too much of a problem out of the fact that it
seems that one must desire something in order to seek it. This
paradox will resolve itself if we are able to experience reality in
this moment clearly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Craving,”
“attachment,” and “desire” are some of the most dangerous
words that can be used to describe something that is actually much
more fundamental than these seem to indicate. The Buddha did talk
about these conventional forms of suffering, but he also talked about
the fundamental suffering that comes from some deep longing for a
refuge that involves a separate or permanent self. We imagine that
such a self will be a refuge, and so we desire such a self, we try to
make certain sensations into such a self, we cling to the fundamental
notion that such a self can exist as a stable entity and that this
will somehow help. The side effects of this manifest in all sorts of
addictions to mind states and emotions that are not helpful, but
these are side effects and not the root that cause of suffering that
the Buddha was pointing to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As stated earlier, a
helpful concept here is compassion, a heart aspect of the practice
and reality related to kindness. You see, wherever there is desire
there is suffering, and wherever there is suffering there is
compassion, the desire for the end of suffering. You can actually
experience this. So obviously there is some really close relationship
between suffering, desire and compassion. This is heavy but good
stuff and worth investigating.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We might conceive of
this as compassion having gotten caught in a loop, the loop of the
illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dog’s tail chasing
itself. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to
be “over there.” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a
constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the
other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You
would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but
somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the sense of a
split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. When unpleasant
sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from over there, to
widen the imagined split. This will never work, because it doesn’t
actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away
from that side is painful. When boring or unpleasant sensations
arise, there is the attempt to tune out all together and forget the
whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side
of the split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it
perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate
reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These strict
definitions of fundamental attraction, aversion and ignorance are
very important, particularly for when I discuss the various models of
the stages of enlightenment. Given the illusion, it seems that
somehow these mental reactions will help in a way that will be
permanent. Remember that the only thing that will fundamentally help
is to understand the Three Characteristics to the degree that makes
the difference, and the Three Characteristics are manifesting right
here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember how it was
stated above that suffering motivates everything we do? We could also
say that everything we do is motivated by compassion, which is part
of the fundamentally empty nature of reality. That doesn’t mean
that everything we do is skillful; that is a whole different issue.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Compassion is a very
good thing, especially when it involves one's self and all beings. It
is sort of the flip side of the Second Noble Truth. The whole problem
is that “misdirected” compassion, compassion that is filtered
through the process of ego and its related habits, can produce
enormous suffering and often does. It is easy to think of many
examples of people searching for happiness in the strangest of places
and by doing the strangest of things. Just pick up any newspaper. The
take-home message is to search for happiness where you are actually
likely to find it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We might say that
compassion is the ultimate aspect of desire, or think of compassion
and desire on a continuum. The more wisdom or understanding of
interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the
more they reflect compassion and the more the results will turn out
well. The more greed, hatred and delusion or lack of understanding of
interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the
more they reflect desire and the more suffering there will likely be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is sometimes
referred to as the “Law of Karma,” where karma is a word that has
to do with our intentions and actions. Some people can get all caught
up in specifics of this that cannot possibly be known, like
speculating that if we kill a bug we will come back as a bug and be
squished. Don't. Cause and effect, also called interdependence, is
just too imponderably complex. Just use this general concept to look
honestly at what you want, why, and precisely how you know this.
Examine what the consequences of what you do and think might be for
yourself and everyone, and then take responsibility for those
consequences. It's a tall order and an important practice to engage
in, but don't get too obsessive about it. Remember the simplicity of
the first training, training in kindness, generosity, honesty and
clarity, and gain balance and wisdom from the other two trainings as
you go.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sometimes looking
into suffering and desire can be overwhelming. Life can sometimes be
extremely hard. In these moments, try looking into the heart side of
the equation, compassion and kindness. Connect with the part of your
heart that just wishes the suffering would end and feel that deeply,
especially as it manifests in the body. Just this can be profound
practice. There are also lots of other good techniques for
cultivating a spaciousness of heart that can bear anything, such as
formal loving-kindness practices (see Sharon Salzburg’s excellent
<u>Loving</u>-<u>kindness</u>, <u>The</u> <u>Revolutionary</u> <u>Art</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Happiness</u>). Finding them and practicing them can
make the spiritual path much more bearable and pleasant, and this can
make it more likely that we will be able to persevere, gain deep
insights, be able to integrate them into our lives, and use them to
benefit others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The take-home
message is to take the desire to be happy and free of suffering and
use its energy to do skillful things that can actually make this
happen, rather than getting caught in old unexamined patterns of
searching for happiness where you know you will not find it. The
Three Trainings are skillful and can inform the whole of our life. By
following them we may come to the end of many forms of suffering and
be in a much better position to help others do the same.</p>

TRUTH NUMBER THREE: THE END OF SUFFERING</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This brings us
nicely to the Third Noble Truth, <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b>
<b>suffering</b>. Now, as noted before, there are three types of
suffering pertaining to the scope of each of the three trainings.
Traditionally, the Buddha talked about the end of suffering as
relating to mastering the third training and thus becoming highly
enlightened. The first point is that it can be done and is done today
by meditators like you from many spiritual traditions. Yes, there are
enlightened people walking around, and not just a rare few that have
spent 20 years in a cave in Tibet. This is really important to
understand and have faith in. The other point is that with the end of
fundamental desire, which we will render here as the end of
compassion and reality being filtered through the odd logic of the
process of ego, there is the end of fundamental suffering. That's it.
Done is what has to be done. Gone, gone, gone beyond, and all of
that. All beings can do it, and there is, to make bit of a mystical
joke, no time like the present.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it must be said
that the Buddha also praised those who had mastered the other two
trainings and thus eliminated what suffering could be eliminated by
those methods. Even very enlightened beings can benefit from
mastering the concentration states. However, there are some complex
and difficult issues related to eliminating all of the ordinary
suffering in the world and thus related to mastering the first
training, which is an endless undertaking. It is because of this
particular issue that such teachings as the Bodhisattva Vow arose,
and I will deal with these complexities towards the end of this book.
</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5490_1179888903"></a><a name="TRUTH_NUMBER_FOUR__THE_PATH"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_29"></a>
TRUTH NUMBER FOUR: THE PATH</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Fourth Noble
Truth is the <b>Noble</b> <b>Eightfold</b> <b>Path</b> <b>that</b>
<b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffering's</b> <b>final</b> <b>end</b> .
Another list! Hopefully you have come to like these little lists by
now, and so one more will hopefully be seen as another manageable
little guide on how to find the end of suffering. Luckily, we have
already seen the whole of the Noble Eightfold Path in other parts of
some of the other lists, and it is summarized in the Three Trainings
of morality, concentration and wisdom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The morality section
is just broken down into three specifics: skillful action, skillful
speech and skillful livelihood. Skillful means conducive to the end
of suffering for us and for all other living beings. Be kind, honest,
clear and compassionate in your whole life, in your actions, speech
and work. Notice that nothing is excluded here. The more of our lives
we integrate with the spiritual path, the better. Simple to remember
and also a powerful guide.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The concentration
section contains three things we saw in the Five Spiritual Faculties
and the Seven Factors of Enlightenment: skillful energy, skillful
concentration, and skillful mindfulness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The wisdom section
has the two last parts of the path: skillful thought or intention and
skillful understanding or wisdom. These two are often rendered in
different ways, but the meaning is the same: understand the truth of
your experience and aspire to kindness and wisdom in your thoughts
and deeds. Again, simple but powerful.</p>

9. PRACTICAL MEDITATION CONSIDERATIONS</h1>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5494_1179888903"></a><a name="WHEN__WHERE_AND_FOR_HOW_LONG"></a>
WHEN, WHERE AND FOR HOW LONG?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The best time to
meditate is when you can, as in “get it while you can!” The best
place to meditate is where you can, and the best duration is for as
long as is available or necessary for you to get what you wish out of
it. This may seem like an obvious answer, but people can sometimes
get it into their heads that certain times are better than others and
thus not meditate when that seemingly sacred time period is
unavailable or interrupted. They may feel that certain places or
special circumstances (special cushions, noise levels, etc.) are
oh-so-necessary, and if these are not available then they may feel
frustrated and unable to practice. They may feel that a certain
minimal duration of meditation time is necessary, and thus find
themselves unable to make use of what time they may have.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you have two
hours each day for meditation, great! If you have two jobs, six kids,
and just can’t find more than ten minutes each day for meditation,
<i>make</i> <i>good</i> <i>use</i> <i>of</i> <i>what</i> <i>you’ve</i>
<i>got</i>. There have been times in my life when I was very grateful
that I had twenty hours a day to practice. On the other hand, when I
have only had ten minutes a day, I have been grateful for the sense
of how precious those ten minutes were. Skillful urgency and
well-developed gratitude for a chance to practice at all can allow us
to really use limited pieces of time to their fullest.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you can take off
a month each year for intensive retreats, wonderful. If a weekend
retreat once a year is all you can do, go for it. In short, honor
where you are and what you can realistically accomplish given your
current circumstances. If they are not entirely to your liking, and
you want to take more time for practice, work on rearranging things a
bit in a way that leaves you with a life that you still find
fulfilling should you later decide to practice a bit less.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Luckily, meditation
is an extremely portable endeavor. You don’t have to lug around
special equipment, have other people around, or schedule an
appointment. There are no fees, waiting lists, or red tape. Reality
happens. Sensations arise. If you’re payin’ careful attention to
them, really feeling exactly what it is like to be here now, you’re
doin’ it! It’s just that simple. While I have definitely come to
appreciate “ideal” meditation conditions and their obvious
benefits, I have also had profound insights and extraordinary
experiences in places that would hardly be considered ideal (e.g. in
the break room at work, while brushing my teeth). While I definitely
appreciate the additional depth of long periods of uninterrupted
practice, I am certain that being able to make use of little bits of
time here and there has done much to move things along.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I sometimes meditate
when reclining before sleep, when reclining in the morning before I
have to get up, when I wake up in the middle of the night, before
catnaps on the couch, during boring lectures and meetings, and in the
lounge of the school I attended before afternoon classes. I have come
to the conclusion that five minutes of really engaged, clear and
focused practice in poor circumstances can often produce more
benefits for me than an hour of poor, vague and distracted practice
in “optimal conditions.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have also come to
appreciate the value of timed sits, where I vow to sit and pay
attention for a defined period of time. I take a little travel alarm
clock or kitchen timer and vow to sit for a predetermined space of
time, usually somewhere from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. I have found
that, during untimed sits, I tend to get up when I run into difficult
territory, mild pain from sitting, or other things that I don’t
want to acknowledge and investigate clearly. A timed sit makes it
much more likely that I will be able to sit in the face of these
things, thus developing more confidence and discipline, as well as
the insights that come from persistent investigation.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5496_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_31"></a><a name="DAILY_LIFE_AND_RETREATS"></a>
DAILY LIFE AND RETREATS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A very related issue
here is that of the world of retreats and monasticism and how it
contrasts with the world of “daily life” or the life of a
“householder.” Each has its own set of issues, but many of them
overlap and the differences may be more question of degree than of
dichotomy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it is true that
the battle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the swift,
but that’s the way to bet. In other words, those who do lots of
practice in daily life, go on more and longer retreats, are more
consistently able to concentrate and investigate quickly and
precisely, pay attention more often during their daily activities,
and have their morality trip more together are, on average, much more
likely to make progress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When on retreat,
people have the opportunity to practice nearly all day in settings
that are usually designed to be very conducive to clear, precise
inquiry and depths of meditation. (Why so few people actually take
advantage of these circumstances when they go on retreat is beyond
me, and I will spend some time ranting about that later.) The point
is that going on retreats can give opportunities for much faster and
deeper practice to those who choose to really practice. Said another
way, if you go on retreat, make good use of that time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a huge
difference between the experiences of people who do retreats halfway
and people who really follow the instructions all day long. In my
experience, there is no comparison between retreats I have done when
I really powered the investigation from the time I awoke until I went
to sleep at night, causing fast and profound progress, and when I
took breaks here and there to think about things such as my issues
and meditation theory, generally causing moderate to slow progress.
While many people think that retreats are for more advanced
practitioners, I think that a few retreats early in one’s practice
can really jump start things, allowing one to then make much better
use of meditation time off retreat.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I often think of the
momentum that retreats generate in terms of rolling a boulder over a
hill. If you get a long running start, pushing hard the whole way,
you are more likely to be able to get the boulder rolling fast enough
so that it rolls over the hill in one straight shot. If you push
intermittently or half-heartedly, the boulder is likely to roll back
when you get to the steep part of the hill, but you have worn the
hill down a little bit, and you may also be a bit stronger for the
exercise. Thus, it is possible to wear down the hill given enough
time, but it is much faster to simply power over it the first time
and move on to the next hill. I know of no obvious benefits from slow
practice that fails to gain some footholds in the territory of
concentration or insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Those who take the
wear down the hill approach may eventually lose faith and interest,
having done lots of work to little effect. Those who really apply
themselves and cross a few hills early on through focused and
consistent effort, such as retreats or really solid daily life
practice, will have more of a sense of accomplishment and mpowerment,
<i>and</i> <i>may</i> <i>have</i> <i>even</i> <i>put</i> <i>in</i>
<i>less</i> <i>total</i> <i>time</i> <i>and</i> <i>effort</i> <i>than</i>
<i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>tried</i> <i>to</i> <i>wear</i> <i>down</i>
<i>the</i> <i>hill</i>. This irony should not be lost on those who
want to be smart about developing their meditative skills.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, lets
say that you could allocate 365 hours out of one year to formal
meditation practice. Given a choice, I would be more inclined to take
half of those hours, about 182, and do a 10 day retreat practicing
hard and consistently 18 hours a day with minimal breaks at the
beginning of the year, and then spend half an hour meditating each of
the other days. I would be much more likely to cross into some
interesting territory early on and overcome some of the initial
hurdles than if I spent one hour each day for that year practicing
well. The amount of time and effort is the same, but the effect is
likely to be quite different.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A few odds and ends
about retreats. First, retreats tend to have a semi-predictable
rhythm to them. Realizing this allows us, if we have the time and
resources to space, to choose how long a retreat we want to meet our
meditative goals. Even if we are practicing well, the first few days
of a retreat tend to be mostly about adjusting to the place, the
posture, the routine, the people, the local customs, the schedule,
etc. Similarly, the last day or two of a retreat tends to bring up
thoughts of what we are going to do next. Thus, to give yourself some
time in the middle when you are not dealing with these things as
much, I recommend greater than 5-day retreats when possible. It is
not that benefit can’t be derived from shorter retreats, but there
is something about those middle days that tends to make strong
concentration and good practice easier to attain.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Second, every
retreat center and tradition has its neurotic shadow aspects and
downsides. This is inevitable, but by identifying them and realizing
that there are ways to have them not slow our investigation down is
helpful. One center where I have spent a bit of time is prone to
attracting very serious, scowling people who trudge around in their
walking practice like the slightest sound or glance from anyone
around them might set them off like a bomb. I have been to another
center where sometimes I have been the only meditator there,
requiring me to have more self motivation and discipline. Another
monastic center I have been to has the whole male hierarchy thing
going which can cause all sorts of reactions from retreatants both
female and male.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then there are
basically always neurotic things around food (huge topic, of which
vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian is just the tip of the iceberg),
bathrooms, quarters, showers, hot water, washing clothes and dishes,
cleaning duties, heating and cooling (one place I have been to has
cantankerous wood stoves in some buildings for heat, another in a
tropical setting has open windows that let the mosquitoes swarm in),
clothing (e.g. some centers have people wear white, others won’t
tolerate skimpy or revealing outfits, some don’t care), fragrances,
chemical sensitivities, incense, morning wake-up bells (too quiet,
too loud, someone forgets to ring it at all), schedules, roommates
(particularly those that snore, smell, are noisy or messy, etc.),
strictness of silence, eye contact or the lack thereof, etiquette
around teachers (e.g. to bow or not, to ask challenging questions or
not, limits on the time we have access to them, their personalities
and neurotic stuff, whether or not they speak the language we speak,
etc.), etiquette of entering rooms with icons (e.g. whether to bow
three times or not), the presence of icons or not (and which icons),
and issues of the orthodoxy of ritual, dogma, posture, hand position,
eating rituals, chanting, vows, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This list doesn’t
include issues of corruption, romances, cults of personality,
affairs, crushes, miscommunications, vendettas, scandals, drug use,
money issues, and all the other things that can sometimes show up
anywhere there are people. In short, whatever you imagine that you or
other people might have issues around, these are bound to show up
sooner or later if you spend enough time in spiritual circles or
retreat centers. While solo practice is an option, that doesn’t get
you away from all of these issues and has its own set of downsides.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The crucial thing is
to realize that great practice can occur in conditions far from
perfect, particularly if we realize that all the sensations that make
up these inputs and our reactions to them are all worthy of
investigation and thus as much a source of ultimate and often
relative wisdom as any other sensations. I have rarely had what I
considered perfect practice conditions, but I have done well and you
can also. That said, some centers, particular retreats, and teachers
are better than others, and it is worth exploring and asking around.
All these things can be particularly distracting and distressing for
a first time retreatant, as often there are some naïve hopes,
however unacknowledged, of walking into the Garden of Eden, sitting
with the Buddha, and hanging out with the most evolved fellow
retreatants one could imagine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When off retreat,
progress is still possible, particularly if one has used retreats to
get past some of the initial hurdles (hills) and get a few tastes of
what is possible. Do not underestimate the value of careful and
honest awareness of what one is going during one’s life off the
cushion. On the other hand, if you want to significantly increase
your chances of tasting the fruits of the path, do your best to make
time for retreats in a way that honors your spiritual goals as well
as your other commitments. One of the reasons for monasticism is that
your commitments become your practice, but there are plenty of people
who have figured out how to live in the world and use retreats and
strong daily practice to achieve the same effects. In fact, in this
unusual time in history, there are plenty of places to sit for very
little money and get great support for practice without having to
deal with all the ritual, dogma and other hassles that are involed in
ordination.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some of my favorite
places to go on retreat are: The Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in
Barre, MA, Bhavana Society in Highview, West Virginia, The Malaysian
Buddhist Meditation Centre (MBMC) in Penang, Malaysia, and Gaia House
near Totnes, England. Also worth mentioning are the Mahasi centers in
Burma (Myanmar), such as Panditarama in Yangon (formerly known as
Rangoon). All of these are easy to find on the Internet. For those
who are really into Mahasi Sayadaw style practice as I am, the Three
Month Retreat at IMS (about $3000), or a few weeks to months at MBMC
(about $1000 to fly there and then a few bucks a day plus donations
to stay) are highly recommended. Both have excellent food and are
very conducive to great practice. It is amazing the things we spend
our time and money doing. As a good friend once said, “If you had
to flip burgers for 13 years to get up the money to do the three
month at IMS, it would be well worth it.” I prefer MBMC for
cultural reasons, but both are great. Burma is a great place to go
for the real deal, but there are some issues around dealing with the
government, the oily food, the culture, the water, the heat, the
parasites, and the malaria-carrying mosquitoes that need to be
strongly considered.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5498_1179888903"></a><a name="POSTURES"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_32"></a>
POSTURES</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The four postures
for meditation that are mentioned in traditional Buddhist practice
are those of sitting, walking, standing and reclining. Each has its
own set of benefits and drawbacks, and each may be useful at one time
or another. Looked at another way, this means that we can meditate in
just about any position we find ourselves. We can be aware of where
we are, what we are doing, and what our experience feels like all day
long. Which posture we choose doesn’t really matter from a pure
insight point of view, but there are some practical reasons why we
might choose one or the other for formal practice. Posture choice is
mostly about finding one that works in our current circumstances and
which matches our current energy level.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Reclining practice
has the advantages of being extremely sustainable, not requiring
attention to maintaining a posture, generally being relatively free
from pain, and of really allowing the attention to turn to subtle
sensations. It has the distinct disadvantage of quickly putting many
people to sleep, and thus most people prefer sitting. A few people,
such as myself, are so naturally wired that they can meditate clearly
when reclining most of the time and may sometimes find sitting just a
bit too intense and edgy. How one will react to the energetic quality
of a posture varies with the individual, the phase of practice and
practical considerations such as how much sleep we got the night
before. It usually doesn’t take much experimentation to let us know
if reclining will work for us or not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sitting is the
classic meditation pose, but it is not so special as some would make
it out to be. I will use the phrase “on the cushion” often in
this book, but I do so because I find it catchy and not because there
is something magical about the sitting posture. When I write “on
the cushion,” I am really referring to formal meditation in any of
these four postures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sitting has the
quality of being more energy-producing than reclining and less
energy-producing than walking and standing. It can also be very
stable once we learn to sit well. However, many people find that
learning to sit well is a whole endeavor in and of itself. There are
lots of &nbsp;postures even within the category of sitting, e.g. in a
chair with our back off the backrest or with our back on the back
rest, in lotus position, in half-lotus position, sitting “Indian
Style” with our legs crossed, in the “Burmese” or “friendly”
position which is like the cross-legged position except that our feet
are both on the floor one in front of the other, in a keeling
position with or without a bench, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Many traditions make
a big deal about exactly how you should sit, with some getting
particularly macho or picky about such things, but in the end it
doesn’t matter so much. The things that seem to matter most are
that you can sustain the posture, that your back be fairly straight
so that you can breathe well, and that you are not permanently
hurting yourself. Aches and pains are common in meditation, but if
they persist for a long time after you get up from sitting,
particularly in your knees, seriously consider modifying your sitting
posture.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Standing is an even
more energy-producing posture than sitting, with the obvious
advantage being that is it even harder to fall asleep when standing
than when sitting. It seems to up the intensity of a meditation
session even more and can be useful when the energy is really low. I
recommend standing with the eyes slightly open to avoid falling over,
though some people can do just fine with their eyes closed. If you
are sitting and finding that you simply cannot stay focused and
awake, try standing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Walking is the most
energetically active of the four postures and also provides a nice
stretch for the joints and back after we have been doing a lot of
sitting. Its strengths are its weaknesses, in that the fact that one
is moving around can make it easier to stay present and also lead to
a lack of stable concentration. Some people consider walking practice
to be very secondary to sitting, but I have learned from experience
that walking meditation should be given just as much respect as
sitting meditation. Whether we walk fast or slow is really not so
important, but that while walking we investigate all the little
sensations that go into walking is. This is a great time to check out
intentions and their relationship to actions, as walking involves a
complex and interesting interplay between these. If you are having
problems staying grounded when walking, I recommend staying primarily
with the physical sensations in the feet and legs, particularly the
sensations of contact between the feet and the ground or floor.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5500_1179888903"></a><a name="OBJECTS_FOR_INSIGHT_PRACTICES"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_33"></a>
OBJECTS FOR INSIGHT PRACTICES</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As mentioned before,
there are lots of insight traditions and they each have their
favorite objects. Whereas from the point of view of pure insight the
object of meditation doesn’t matter, as with postures there are
some other practical considerations related to our particular
abilities and the current phase of our practice that are worth taking
into account. It should be noted here that no objects are inherently
objects for insight practice versus concentration practice. The
difference is whether or not we investigate the Three Characteristics
of those objects or ignore the fact that the object is made up of
individual sensations and thus artificially solidify it. Thus, you
could use any of the objects mentioned below (as well as many others)
for either type of practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first question
is whether or not one has a particular agenda for what kind of
sensations or focus one wishes to include in the practice, i.e.
whether one wants to do “choiceless awareness” practice or a more
structured practice. Choiceless awareness practice, in which one
investigates whatever arises without a more specific focus, has the
advantage of being very inclusive and “natural,” and yet by the
same token some people can easily get distracted and ungrounded when
they don’t take a more structured approach.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For those taking a
more structured approach, the axes one can move on are the degree to
which one includes physical or mental sensations in meditation,
whether or not one focuses narrowly or uses a more open field of
attention, and whether or not one moves the attention around or keeps
it in about the same place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The primary
advantage of trying to focus primarily on physical sensations, such
as the breath, the sensations of walking, the points of contact with
the floor, or the sensations of our physical body in general, is that
they are much less seductive than mental sensations. Mental
sensations tend to trap us in the content and stories, as anyone who
has ever tried to meditate knows all to well. The more mental
sensations we include in our practice, the more of our emotional and
psychological stuff we will encounter. This can be a mixed blessing.
If our practice is very strong, we can enter such territory and yet
still see the true nature &nbsp;of all of the sensations that make it
up. If our practice is not very strong, we will simply be swamped,
lost in the habitual patterns of thinking associated with our
“stuff.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, physical
sensations help us ground ourselves, and mental sensations open us up
to plunging into the depths of mental life or getting lost in it.
From a pure insight point of view, neither one is more holy or more
of a source of truth. However, when we do the experiment we will
quickly realize what works for us; “works” in this case meaning
that we can keep seeing the true nature of the numerous quick
sensations that make up our reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are numerous
other types of physical objects that may be investigated, including
sounds, sights, and even smells and tastes. Some people have a
natural proclivity for investigating the sensations of a particular
sense door. There is a monk in Burma that recommends his students use
the high-pitched tones in our ear as an object, and sometimes I have
found them very useful and interesting. Rather than seeming to be a
continuous tone, we can hear each little individual sensation of
ringing as a discontinuous entity. We may also take sights as object,
such as the colors on the back of our eyelids or, if our eyes are
open, whatever visual sensations present themselves. These are also
impermanent, and if we are good at this we may even see our visual
world presenting itself like the frames of a movie.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another
consideration is whether to use a narrow or broad focus of attention.
The advantage of a more narrow focus of attention is that it may
exclude many distractions. We may get very good at seeing certain
selected types of objects, such as the sensations of breathing in the
abdomen or at the tip of the nose, and this is just fine and even a
very good idea. Such one pointed practice is routinely recommended,
and some people, such as myself, have a natural inclination towards
this style.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Others find that
this makes them too tight and irritable. However, they find that they
do much better with a wider and more inclusive field of attention.
These things vary with the person and the situation, and if we are
honest with ourselves we will be able to know what is working for us
and what is not. The advantage of a wide field of attention is that
we need to put less effort into staying focused and can be more
present to whatever arises naturally. The downside is that we may
become very lazy meditators and get lost in thought. These tradeoffs
must be weighed against each other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are practices,
such as body sweeping, that keep the attention moving all the time.
This can be very helpful, as it keeps us engaged with new and
interesting sensations and may keep us from getting into ruts of
thinking that we are staying with new sensations when really we are
just remembering old patterns. However, these practices have the
downside that they can sometimes lack the real precision of honest
attention that comes from staying with more restricted areas of
focus. We can end up giving more attention to keeping our attention
moving than to clearly investigating what our attention reveals.
Again, some people do well with moving attention practices and some
seem to thrive on keeping the attention in one place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It should be noted
that we may not always know exactly what is best for us. We may pick
practices that feel good to us precisely because they don’t hit too
closely, don’t allow us to clearly investigate the disconcerting
truths of impermanence and suffering, don’t hit at our sense of
identity in a way that really cuts to the bone. We might also pick
traditions that are grueling and very painful for us because we
imagine that this is what is important, even if such traditions do
not facilitate clear investigations of the truth of our actual
experience. Thus, working with good teachers who can advise us and
help us keep from resting in our delusions is recommended. That said,
some teachers only teach one practice, usually the particular one
that worked for them. If that is also a technique that genuinely
works for us, then we are set. If not, we may wish to investigate
other traditions and techniques.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On a related note, I
have advocated figuring out what works for you, considering how you
are built and where you are. I do, however, recommend moderation in
this. For instance, if you sit down to meditate and then decide that
you are just a bit sleepy, so you stand up, and then you settle down
a bit, so a few minutes later you sit down again. Then a minute later
you decide you really don’t like that little pain in your knee and
so you lie down, and so it goes. Such practice is likely to be of
little benefit to you, so try to pick a posture and stick with it
within reason. The same applies to objects of meditation,
particularly when you are starting out. There is a lot to be said for
cultivating this basic level of self-control and discipline. Without
it, we can end up shifting our practice habits every time our
investigation begins to hit close to home.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5502_1179888903"></a><a name="RESOLVE"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_34"></a>
RESOLVE</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That brings me to
the topic of resolve. I strongly recommend developing the freedom to
choose what happens in your life that comes from discipline. While
people often think of discipline as being contrary to freedom, I
equate the two in many ways. Discipline and resolve allow one to make
choices about what we do and stay strong in the face of difficulties.
Thus, I recommend that when you set aside a period of time for a
particular training, you resolve that for that period you will work
on the specific training you have set out to work on, and that you
will work on it whole-heartedly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Without discipline,
without formal resolve, you may easily find yourself in something
resembling the following situation. You sit down on the cushion with
the vague intention to do some insight practices, and begin trying to
investigate, but soon you find yourself thinking about how you really
should be paying your bills. Then your knee begins to hurt, so you
tune into the low-level jhanic bliss that you have managed to
cultivate the ability to find, and then you feel hungry, so you get
up and fix yourself a sandwich. You then think to yourself, “Hey,
what am I doing here eating this sandwich? Wasn’t I doing insight
practice?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You are not free.
Instead, you are floundering. Without discipline, without resolve,
you are unlikely to be able to get past some of the difficult hurdles
that stand between you and success in any of these trainings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have found it
extremely valuable, particularly when sitting down to do formal
meditation, to state to myself at the beginning of the session
exactly what I am doing, what I hope to attain by it, and why
attaining that is a good idea. I do this formally and clearly, either
out loud or silently to myself. Having done practice with and without
them, I have come to the definite conclusion that formal resolutions
can make a huge difference in my practice. One of my favorite
resolutions goes something like, “I resolve that for this hour I
will consistently investigate the sensations that make up reality so
as to attain to liberating insights for the benefit of myself and all
beings.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Resolutions such as
this one add a great deal of focus and consciousness to my practice.
They galvanize my energy, make plain my intentions, and also seem to
work at some more subliminal or subconscious level to help keep me on
track. I have also found that I can use resolutions in my daily life
to good effect. For instance, when studying for a medical school
exam, I might resolve, “For this hour, I will study this hematology
syllabus so that I will increase my knowledge and skill as an
aspiring doctor and thus be less likely to kill patients and more
likely to help them.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Such resolutions
might seem overly formal or perhaps even goofy, and they sometimes
seem this way to me, but I have come to appreciate them anyway. If I
make resolutions that do not ring true, I can feel it when I say
them, and this helps me understand my own path and heart. If I am
lost and wondering why I am doing what I am doing, these sorts of
resolutions help me to consciously reconnect with what is important
in life. I suggest that you try making these sorts of resolutions in
your own life, at least so that you can see if they are useful for
you. I am a big fan of formal resolutions, but you should see for
yourself.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5504_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_35"></a><a name="TEACHERS"></a>
TEACHERS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are many types
of teachers out there from many traditions. Some are very ordinary
and some seem to radiate spirituality from every pore. Some are nice,
some are indifferent, and some may seem like sergeants in boot camp.
Some stress reliance on one’s own efforts, others stress reliance
on the grace of the guru. Some are very available and accessible, and
some may live far away, grant few interviews, or have so many
students vying for their time that you may rarely get a chance to
talk with them. Some seem to embody the highest ideals of the
perfected spiritual life in their every waking moment, while others
may have many noticeable quirks, faults and failings. Some live by
rigid moral codes, while others may push the boundaries of social
conventions and mores. Some may be very old, and some may be very
young. Some may require strict commitments and obedience, while
others may hardly seem to care what we do at all. Some may advocate
very specific practices, stating that their way is the only way or
the best &nbsp;way, while others may draw from many traditions or be
open to your doing so. Some may point out our successes, while others
may dwell on our failures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some may stress
renunciation or even ordination into a monastic order, while others
seem relentlessly engaged with “the world.” Some charge a bundle
for their teachings, while others give theirs freely. Some like
scholarship and the lingo of meditation, while others may never use
or even openly despise these formal terms and conceptual frameworks.
Some teachers may be more like friends or equals that just want to
help us learn something they happened to be good at, while others may
be all into the hierarchy, status and role of being a teacher. Some
teachers will speak openly about attainments, and some may not. Some
teachers are remarkably predictable in their manner and teaching
style, while others swing wide in strange and unpredictable ways.
Some may seem very tranquil and mild mannered, while others may seem
outrageous or rambunctious. Some may seem extremely humble and
unimposing, while others may seem particularly arrogant and
presumptuous. Some are charismatic, while others may be distinctly
lacking in social skills. Some may readily give us extensive advice,
and some just listen and nod. Some seem the living embodiment of
love, and others may piss us off on a regular basis. Some teachers
may instantly click with us, while others just leave us cold. Some
teachers may be willing to teach us, and some may not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So far as I can
tell, none of these are related in any way to their meditation
ability or the depths of their understanding. That is, don’t judge
a meditation teacher by their cover. What is important is that their
style and personality inspire us to practice well, to live the life
we want to live, to find what it is we wish to find, to understand
what we wish to understand. Some of us may wander for a long time
before we find a good fit. Some of us will turn to books for
guidance, reading and practicing without the advantages or hassles of
teachers. Some of us may seem to click with a practice or teacher,
try to follow it for years and yet get nowhere. Others seem to fly
regardless. One of the most interesting things about reality is that
we get to test it out. One way or another, we will get to see what
works for us and what doesn’t, what happens when we do certain
practices or follow the advice of certain teachers, as well as what
happens when we don’t.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing about
teachers is that they only know what they know. If we use the scopes
of the Three Trainings to examine this, we may find that some
teachers may have a good grasp of some of these scopes and not have a
good grasp of the others. In fact, mastery in any area guarantees
nothing about mastery of the others. It is worth being realistic
about this fact, and so I will go on and on about this later.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, when we
interact with teachers, we may wish to also consider which of their
bodies of knowledge we wish to draw on, i.e. which of the Three
Trainings we want help with. In fact, I think that it is very
important to be clear about this explicitly, so that when we go in to
talk with a teacher, we can ask questions from the correct conceptual
framework and also fit their advice back into the correct framework.
If we ask a teacher about how to attain to some high state and they
mention tuning into boundless joy, and we then try to do this when
driving to work and crash into the rear end of the car of some poor
commuter, we have not followed their advice properly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Similarly, we may
wish to explicitly ask our teachers if they are skilled in the aspect
of the specific training we are interested in mastering and also to
what level. While you cannot always trust them to tell the truth,
either through their own self-deception or the desire to fool you, if
they do say something like, “No, I don’t know enough to speak on
that level, as my own abilities are not that strong yet,” then at
least you know to seek advice elsewhere. I have much more respect for
a teacher who once told me that he didn’t feel qualified to teach
me than for the numerous teachers who were not qualified to teach me
who either didn’t realize this or tried to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, I would
recommend making your goals for your life and practice specific. For
instance, you may wish to get a job as a dishwasher so that you can
continue to feed yourself. You go to the meditation teacher and say,
“I want to get a job as a dishwasher. Do you know how to do this?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They may say, “Yes.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To which you could
reply, “How do you know this?” They could just as easily have
said, “I have no idea, as I am a meditation teacher, not a career
counselor or restaurant manager.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The same basic
conversational pattern could be repeated just as easily for the other
two trainings. For instance, you could ask a meditation teacher, “I
wish to learn how to get into the early concentration states. Do you
know how to do this?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You could also ask,
“I wish to attain to the first stage of enlightenment. Do you know
how to do this?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If they say, “Yes,”
the next question would be, “What are the specific steps that will
likely produce that result?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This sort of
straightforward approach to spirituality is extremely pragmatic and
empowering. Further, it makes interactions with teachers more
fruitful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This brings me to
another point: teachers can generally tell if you are serious and if
you have clearly thought through what you want. For instance, it
takes about two seconds of someone asking a meditation teacher for
advice on their emotional stuff for the teacher to realize that this
person is interested on working on conventional happiness and is not
interested in learning insight practices. Similarly, it takes few
conversations with a student to figure out if they are following your
advice or not, so don’t try to fool them. If you don’t like their
advice, better to tell them that and also why so that they can
address this, either by modifying their advice or by further
explaining why they feel their advice might be helpful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, if you
follow some of their advice but change parts, or select parts and add
on other things, and then find that this way of working has not
produced the desired results, be careful about criticizing the
teacher or the method, as you have not done the experiment they
recommended. For instance, if someone told you to stabilize your
attention on the individual sensations that make up the experience of
breathing so clearly that you can see the beginning and ending of
every single sensation consistently for an hour, and instead you do
something else or stop the practice before you can do this, don’t
blame them if you do not get the results they promised. Barring
insurmountable external circumstances, the choice not to do the work
was clearly yours, and thus you should accept personal responsibility
for your own failure. I am not trying to be harsh but simply
realistic. I am obviously a firm believer that people should take
responsibility for what happens in their lives and practices. Not
doing so is tantamount to disempowering yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While all of this
advice on practices and teachers may seem a bit overwhelming,
reconnecting with the basics, the simple truths of the spiritual
life, is highly recommended. To that end...</p>

&nbsp;10. SUMMARY</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The more we practice
being kind and compassionate, the more we connect with the
fundamental nature of our hearts and the better our conventional
lives will be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The more we practice
being clear and equanimous, the more we connect with the true nature
of our mind and the healthier our minds will be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The more we practice
understanding the Three Characteristics of all the little sensations
that make up our reality, the more we penetrate into the fundamental
nature of reality and the closer we are to awakening and to freedom
from fundamental suffering.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5508_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_37"></a><a name="11__CONCLUSION_TO_PART_I"></a>
&nbsp;11. CONCLUSION TO PART I</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">People have noticed
a decrease in the importance of poetry to our society. It has been
said that our desire for more information, faster images and quick
sound bites is increasing. We are searching faster and faster,
perhaps at the expense of looking more deeply.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Rather than sitting
with a Shakespeare sonnet for a few minutes, just pondering the
beauty and meaning of it, we might read ten of them quickly and then
feel a bit befuddled. Similarly, one might read though a dense little
work like this one without stopping to ponder each paragraph along
the way and thus perhaps get little out of it. Just so, we may be
constantly trying to find the next teacher, book, spiritual scene,
technique, incense, mantra, costume, or doctrine that will get us the
Big E. Quick results are actually possible, though there are no
promises about the speed of progress that can be given. Real progress
will only come when we settle into the basics, into this moment, and
go deep.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These lists are good
sources of the basic teachings that are sufficient to do the trick.
Go deeply into them, or find them in another form, perhaps in another
tradition, and go deeply into them. Slow down. Settle into these
simple truths, reflect, and then practice with diligence!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Good teachers can
help; they are nearly a necessity and so are highly recommended, but
you must do the work yourself. You must understand, and then you will
have to do this again and again. Get used to it, as it can be quite
an adventure.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is sometimes hard
for people to believe that right there in their experience is what
they are looking for. It is right here, right now, in your own
experience, in your own heart, mind and body. It is these sensations
right now that are just soaked with the truth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Forgive me, but one
more time up on my soapbox. There is so much completely useless and
harmful sectarianism in the spiritual world, within Buddhism and
between Buddhism and the other spiritual traditions. People can get
so into their particular trip and get all down on the other perfectly
good spiritual trips. This is faith out of balance causing rigid
adherence to dogma, isn't it? This is a lack of understanding of what
the basics are and what are just the inevitable cultural trappings
and individual emphases of each tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These are the
basics. Wherever you find a tradition with the components of even one
of these lists, regardless of what they are called or how they are
formulated, you find a tradition with the potential to awaken. Sure,
there is a lot of junk spirituality out there, but there is also a
lot of really good stuff.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, each
tradition has its strengths and weaknesses, and some may have
cultural trappings and ornamentation that you like or don't like, but
don’t make a big deal about this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Instead, keep the
basics in the front of your mind. Each valid tradition can help us
gain further insight into the truth, and perhaps we will resonate
with one teaching or tradition at one time and another some time
later. Alternately, we can pick one tradition, not be sectarian about
it, and go deep into it, into the simplicity and clarity of its
basics, using its extrapolations, elaborations and interpretations to
go back more deeply into the simple truths. We can engage with the
ordinary world, with the truth of this moment, and this will empower
us and may awaken us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">May this writing be
of benefit to you and all beings, and may you and all beings realize
the simple truth of things in this lifetime.</p>

&nbsp;12. INTRODUCTION TO PARTS II &amp; III</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some chapters in
Parts II and III have a distinctly cutting tone. This is intentional,
though no harm is meant by it. There are a lot of shadow sides to
Buddhism and mystical traditions in general, some of which will be
discussed here. Perhaps a more cutting tone will help to illuminate
points that tend to be unmentioned or poorly addressed. Perhaps it
will also serve to spark skillful debate and inquiry, rather than
causing needless contraction into fear and dogma. However, I should
warn you now, some of the next three chapters have quite a bite to
them. There is no information in those chapters that is essential to
any of the basic practices. If you are not in the mood for some
really heavy and scathing social commentary on Western Buddhism,
please, <i>skip</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>chapter</i> <i>called</i>
<i>A</i> <i>Clear</i> <i>Goal</i> <i>now</i>!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The practical reason
for including Part II at all is that what often happens between
trying to apply the basics of technical meditation discussed in Part
I and the successful entry into real meditation territory discussed
in Part III is that we run into the mainstream culture of Western
Buddhism and the communities that develop around it. We need support,
friends who are into what we are into, good teachers and places to
practice. We wish to be in the company of fellow adventurers rather
than lone wanderers in strange lands. Unfortunately, much of what we
find is not particularly conducive to adventure and deep exploration
at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, as one small
dissenting voice against the tide, I have included Part II to help
those who want to go much deeper than most of those around them and
avoid the numerous cultural sidetracks and disempowering voices that
will keep them from their goals. It is as much a laundry list of my
pet peeves as it is anything else, but I am happy to own my neuroses
and make them overt. While I may be fooling myself, I think this
section, while a bit harsh and probably disrespectful, is likely to
be helpful to someone who also wishes to go against the grain and
become an actual meditation master.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The real dangers
that come from using a cutting tone are that it will alienate both
readers for whom such a tone is simply not helpful and those who
could really benefit from such a tone but do not want to admit this.
Worse, it may cause others to agree too strongly, thinking, “Oh,
yes, even though that Daniel fellow sometimes writes like a raving
lunatic, he and I are really on the same side. We know what is going
on. Those over there are the ones who really need to hear this.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We all need to hear
the points made in this book, myself included, though not necessarily
in the style presented here. The ideals and standards presented in
this book are very high so that they will be able to be applied
universally. Further, the numerous traps and pitfalls presented in
this book are also so common that all of us need to be wary,
reflecting regularly and honestly on how we have fallen into them
once more.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are quite a
number of very readable, helpful and friendly dharma books out there,
e.g. Jack Kornfield’s encyclopedic masterwork, <u>A</u> <u>Path</u>
<u>with</u> <u>Heart</u>, many of which are loaded with brilliant
statements that should basically shock and confound the reader,
hitting at the very core of their sense of identity with the deadly
accuracy of a Master of Zen Archery. However, as they have been
written in a style that is so completely accessible, these statements
have nearly the opposite effect, creating a mushy comfort in the
reader with statements that should have stopped them in their
proverbial tracks and provoked deep inquiry.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have grown tired
of people routinely quoting profound dharma statements from such
works as if this represents their understanding when they have no
idea what they mean. They seem to derive some false comfort from
being able to parrot the masters. While I can understand the appeal
of behaving in such ways, as I have done so myself on numerous
occasions, I will do my best to keep the second two parts of this
book from contributing to this phenomena. Thus, I have intentionally
written some sections of Parts II and III in a style that is designed
to sound combative and abrasive. Also, I must admit that it was fun
to write that way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It should be noted
that if you got through Part I (which I tried to make very
“accessible”) without being stunned at the staggering profundity
of the statements made on nearly every page, then you either have no
need to read this book or you fell into the trap I just mentioned
above. I think that most spiritual practitioners could and should
become very much more comfortable admitting what they don’t know
and seeking clarification. The times when I myself have failed to do
so have been much to my detriment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In these next two
parts, I will often mention very specific high states and attainments
for the purpose of attempting in some small way to refocus Buddhism
on those things that go far beyond philosophy, psychology, and
dogmatic religion. It is full enlightenment that finally makes the
difference and was, according to the Buddha himself, the whole reason
for all of this. Unfortunately, even fairly rational adults can
suddenly lose the ability to stay in touch with ordinary reality when
such language is used, and I will do my best to try to counteract
this and bring things back down to Earth whenever possible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It has become almost
taboo to mention actual attainment or mastery of this stuff among
many meditation communities, and this is grossly unfortunate, which
is to say it is completely ridiculous and frighteningly ironic. Some
reasons for this will be touched on occasionally, as well as some of
what might be able to be done about this. However, if we are to have
a clear standard for whether or not these techniques and teachings
are working for us, it is vital that we have a thorough knowledge of
what is possible and even expected of those who really practice well.
That is the primary reason for Part III. Remember, you are reading a
book called <u>Mastering</u> <u>the</u> <u>Core</u> <u>Teachings</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Buddha</u>. It has been written on the
assumption that its readers actually want to do this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That said, there
will probably be readers who will think that most of what is written
in Part III, which details the stages of enlightenment, the high
concentration attainments, and even more unusual territory, is pure
fantasy, myth, dogma and nonsense. I have little to say to these
readers except that this book is obviously not written for them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I hope that you will
realize the difficulties inherent in language, concepts, doctrines,
and maps of spiritual terrain. They are particularly clumsy tools
even when used to their fullest potential, and this is unlikely to
have happened here. Despite the fact that I will often use a tone
implying certainty, it should be said that nothing whatsoever that I
have written here is absolutely true. Language at its best is a
useful tool, though by its very nature it artificially divides,
reduces and oversimplifies. Hopefully, one will concern oneself with
what is pragmatic rather than what is absolutely correct from some
arbitrary point of view. The crucial thing is practice and direct
experience for one’s self. Once you understand for yourself, you
will be able to laugh knowingly at my efforts.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5514_1179888903"></a><a name="13__BUDDHISM_VS__THE_BUDDHA"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_40"></a>
&nbsp;13. BUDDHISM VS. THE BUDDHA *</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of my teachers
once commented, “Buddhism and the teachings of the Buddha have been
at odds for 2,500 years!” These are cynical but appropriate words.
What the Buddha taught was really extremely simple and, as a
practice, particularly unglamorous and generally quite difficult
though manageable. If one has a chance to read the original texts,
one sees again and again that what the Buddha taught was generally
practical and as non-dogmatic as could be expected. He basically
said, “Do these very specific things, and these specific results
will happen.” He had little use for ritual, ceremony or philosophy
that was not for some practical purpose.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it is true that
things did get a bit more complex and religious in the later years of
his teaching as <u>The</u> <u>Vinaya</u>, or code of conduct for
monks, was established. The Buddha said that the added rules and
regulations were a response to the increased quantity of low-quality
students with whom he had to work in the later years of his life and
the problems inherent in running a large organization. After the
Buddha died, however, the process of turning the teachings of the
Buddha from a practical path for awakening into a number of
ritualistic religions reached new extremes of dogma and division. It
is also true, however, that many worthwhile and practical variations
on the fundamental teachings and techniques have been added that have
provided great benefit to many of those who actually followed them
rather than just talked about them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In general, as
mystical teachings become religions, all sorts of things get added on
to them depending on the prevailing cultural norms, the current
government’s attitude towards the teachings, how well or poorly the
teachings are understood by those teaching them, and economic
pressures. Christianity as a dogma (rather than as a mystical
tradition or set of spiritual practices, e.g. sitting in the desert
for 40 days, facing one’s demons, and finding God) is a just one
scary example of this, but perhaps no scarier than the religions of
Buddhism. Just as Christianity often seems to have little to do with
what Jesus was talking about (and practically nothing to do with
doing the practices he did or living the kind of life he did) just so
Buddhism often seems to have largely forgotten about the core
teachings of the Buddha. As Buddhism enters America, a whole new
layer of cultural dust is being added to it, most of which is related
to the shadow sides of Western psychology and those of the New Age
movement. However, there are also signs that fresh new life and
health is being breathed into aspects of Buddhism that had become
somewhat moldy and calcified in their countries of origin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The extra trappings
are not necessarily all harmful in and of themselves, but they may
dilute the amount of practical information about how to awaken with
all sorts of other information that may have little to do with
awakening and may even be an impediment to it. This may then lead to
less than complete emphasis on the three fundamental trainings in
morality, concentration and wisdom, which are quite a handful and a
great undertaking even in their most simple forms. I was extremely
lucky, in that I learned some great Buddhist meditation technology
long before I really got to know the culture of mainstream Western
Buddhism. I have much use for the former, and as for the latter,
well, read on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is true that
Buddhist training can take on many valid forms, and this is a fine
and beautiful thing, as different training methods may be appropriate
for different meditators at different times. The added “padding”
of tradition and religion can be a comfort and a support, as most
people seem to really like having some kind of dogmatic, mythical or
cultural foundation from which to work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Traditions and
standardized conceptual frameworks can also provide the means by
which people can talk to each other about experiences and techniques
that might otherwise be very hard to explain clearly. I have a friend
from another mystical tradition who knows much that I find useful and
interesting, but it took us months to even begin to line up our
terminology so that we could benefit from each other’s
understanding.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, these
conceptual frameworks and trappings may also produce the huge amount
of useless, harmful and divisive sectarianism that exists within
Buddhism and between the various meditative or mystical traditions,
as well as all sorts of effort going into things that produce no
freedom and may cause other forms of suffering.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Every time I leave
my sheltered little academic life and enter the rough and tumble
world of endlessly petty, sectarian dharma scenes, I am again
astounded at how fixated people can be on the minute differences
between their tradition and traditions that are so similar to theirs
they can only be differentiated by the clothes people wear and the
names they call things. I can’t tell you how tiring it is.
Sometimes I wonder how these otherwise kind and reasonable people can
stand themselves or each other when they are like that. We all want
to be special, but I beg you, find a way to be special that allows
others to be special also. <i>It</i> <i>is</i> <i>what</i> <i>is</i>
<i>common</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>great</i> <i>mystical</i> <i>paths</i>
<i>that</i> <i>makes</i> <i>them</i> <i>special</i>. <i>The</i>
<i>differences</i> <i>are</i> <i>100</i>% <i>guaranteed</i> <i>to</i>
<i>be</i> <i>fundamentally</i> <i>irrelevant</i>. Now, that said, I
am going to turn around and bust on cultural aspects of traditions
that are not into awakening and mastering what the Buddha was talking
about. This is Buddhism, after all, and so it seems only natural that
I should be into what the old boy was into.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have heard way too
many conversations between members of differing mystical traditions
that could be summarized, “My dogma and ideals are better than your
dogma and ideals.” Even worse are the rare and astonishing
conversations that might be summarized, “My dogma and ideals are
better than your actual realizations and profound insights.”
Frightening.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a movement
in the West, reminiscent of the original objectives of the Buddha in
the early days of his teaching, to divorce Buddhism’s core
meditation technology and basic trainings from religion and ritual
entirely. I am a great fan of this movement, so long it does not
cause people to throw out too many of the original Buddhist
conceptual frameworks that are helpful as tools for mastering these
practices. There is also a movement in the West to take the
meditative technology of Buddhism and integrate it into everything
from Catholicism to psychiatry to the freakish fringe of the New Age.
I don’t have a problem with this trend particularly, just as long
as people realize that you could just as easily divorce these
technologies from those traditions and have something that is still
very useful and powerful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is another
related movement in the West, and that is to make Buddhism into
something for everyone. Unfortunately, what is happening is that
Buddhism is becoming watered down in order to make it have broad
appeal. The result is something very similar to what happens in
places like Thailand, where most people “practice Buddhism” in a
way that is largely devotional and dogmatic. In the West, this
translates to people “practicing Buddhism” by becoming neurotic
about being Buddhist, accumulating lots of pretty books and expensive
props, learning just enough of some new language to be pretentious,
and by sitting on a cushion engaged in free-form psychological
whatnot while doing nothing resembling meditative practices. They may
aspire to no level of mastery of anything and may never even have
been told what these practices were actually designed to achieve.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, their
meditation is largely a devotional meditation, something that
externally looks like meditation but achieves little. In short, it is
just one more spiritual trapping, though one that may have some
social benefits. Many seem to have substituted the pain of the pew
for the pain of the zafu with the results and motivations being
largely the same. It is an imitation of meditation done because
meditation seems like a good and noble thing to do. However, it is a
meditation that has been designed by those “teachers” who want
everyone to be able to feel good that they are doing something
“spiritual”. While it is good for a person to slow down to take
time out for silence, I will claim that beyond these and a few
cardiovascular benefits there is often not a whole lot of any great
worth that comes from this sort of practice. True, they are not out
smoking crack, but why get so close to the real thing and then not do
those practices that make a real difference?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Many will consider
my devaluation of low-grade sitting practice radical and
counterproductive. Perhaps it is, but I claim that many who would
have aspired to much more are being short-changed by not being
invited to really step up to the plate and play ball, to discover the
profound capabilities hidden within their own minds. This book is
designed to be just such an invitation, an invitation to step far
beyond the increasingly ritualized, bastardized, and gutless mock-up
of Buddhism that is rearing its fluffy head in the modern West and
has a strangle hold on many a practice group and even some of the big
meditation centers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To be fair, it is
true that spiritual trappings and cultural add-ons may, at their
best, be “skillful means,” ways of making difficult teachings
more accessible and ways of getting more people to practice correctly
and in a way that will finally bring realization. A fancy hat or a
good ritual can really inspire some people. That said, it is lucky
that one of the fundamental “defilements” that drops away at
first awakening is attachment to rites and rituals, i.e. Buddhism,
ceremony, specific techniques, and religious and cultural trappings
in general. Unfortunately, the cultural inertia of the religions of
Buddhism is hard to entirely circumvent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It need not be, if
the trappings can serve as “skillful means,” but I assert that
many more people could be much more careful about what are
fundamentally helpful teachings and what causes division, confusion,
and sectarian arrogance. Those who aren’t careful about this are at
least demonstrating in a roundabout way that they don’t know what
the fundamental teachings are for themselves and have attained little
wisdom.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5516_1179888903"></a><a name="14__CONTENT_AND_ULTIMATE_REALITY"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_41"></a>
14. CONTENT AND ULTIMATE REALITY *</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is too much
content-centered Buddhism and content-centered spirituality in
general. It is not that content isn’t important, but it is only
half of the picture, and the half we are already quite familiar with
and typically stuck in. By content, I mean everything except
determined effort to realize the full truth of the Three
Characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and no-self, i.e. to
realize ultimate reality. Perhaps two illustrations will help.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first odd
phenomenon I have noticed is that when students of meditation gather
together to discuss Buddhism, they almost never talk about actual
meditation practices in depth and detail. They almost never talk
about their diligent attempts to really understand these teachings in
each moment. It is almost an unacknowledged taboo that nearly any
politically correct topic under the Sun is acceptable as long as it
doesn’t have to do with trying to master meditation techniques.
While there are sporadic moments of “dharma combat” or heated
discussion for the purpose of learning and sharing the dharma, even
these tend to be mostly on the philosophy of all of this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The second odd
phenomenon I have noticed has occurred in situations when one might
suspect that there would not be this problem. I have been to a fair
number of retreats in the West, and these tend to have small group
meetings. The dharma teachers have invariably been giving
instructions that emphasize following the motion of the breath or the
sensations of the feet, developing concentration on these objects,
not being lost in thought, and giving precise attention to bare
reality just as it is. They tend to use the phrase “moment to
moment” often, which in my book means, “Fast!” This is all as
it should be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They tend to mention
things like impermanence, suffering, and no-self, and tend to
advocate trying to understand these qualities of all experience
directly without the elaboration of thought. They mention time and
time again that one should not be lost in the stories and tape loops
of the mind. They may have traveled thousands of miles at great
expense to help people understand these teachings that they
themselves may have spent many years learning. For the hundreds of
dollars in retreat fees, donations, and spent vacation time, the
students will perhaps get three meetings with the teacher during a
10-day retreat and perhaps get fifteen to twenty precious minutes of
time to talk to a real meditation master, assuming they are lucky
enough to actually be sitting with one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, when some
eight to ten students finally get a chance to meet with the teacher
in a small group meeting, a brief chance to really learn what this
teacher has to teach, what happens? Do they talk about their
whole-hearted attempts at following the careful and skillful
instructions of the teacher? Strangely, this only seems to happen on
rare occasions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I was at one of
these small group meetings where everyone was talking about their
neurotic stuff. In a moment of feeling like I might be able to
actually add something useful, I said in a loud and exasperated
voice, “The breath! Is anyone trying to notice the breath?” They
just looked at me like I was out of my mind and went back to whining
about their psychological crap. Here was a roomful of otherwise
accomplished adults who somehow had been transformed into needy and
pathetic children without any obvious ability to deal with their
lives or follow very basic instructions. Beware of meditation
cultures that consistently encourage this in people. It is a mark of
something gone horribly wrong.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Stranger even than
this, when students actually do talk about trying to follow the
careful instructions of their meditation teachers, it can
occasionally seem to be such a shock to teachers, such a violation of
the unwritten taboos, and perhaps even such a threat to the hierarchy
that they sometimes hardly seem to know how to handle it. In my more
cynical moments, I have sometimes suspected that the quickest way to
get worried looks from many modern Western meditation teachers is to
talk about practice in a way that implies the attempt to actually
master anything.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Most of the time
students tend to whine about their relationships, their childhood,
their neurotic thoughts, their screwed up lives, in short, content. I
must say that I have great sympathy for these people. I really do.
God knows we all have this sort of stuff to whine about; and, in the
right context, whining about our stuff might be a very good idea. But
two things are fairly clear: these people have spent too little time
in therapy (or perhaps too much time in bad therapy), and somehow
have not heard one word of what the teacher has been talking about as
regards insight practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it is
absolutely true that we all have our issues, pains, traumas, scars
and quirks. We have to learn to deal with these somehow if we want to
be happy and live the good life we all want to live. We have to find
ways to deal with the content, to heal, to grow, to mature, and all
of that, but we must also learn when to shift to seeing things on a
completely different level. There is a time and a place for
everything.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Imagine if you were
an algebra teacher and you told your students to solve the homework
in the back of chapter one. Instead, your students turn in long,
rambling essays about the traumas of their childhood. How would you
feel? Unfortunately, you would feel like many meditation teachers.
Now, it is true that many dharma teachers have a great time helping
people deal with their stuff, and some of these are even quite good
at it. There are others that put up with having to play this role,
but they would prefer to be teaching insight practices. Some teachers
just can’t stand it when they spend lots of time giving careful
instructions only to have very few people follow them, particularly
when they know what an amazing opportunity for even deeper healing,
increased well-being and clarity is being squandered by their
students when they fail to really practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sometimes people
have actually heard just a bit of the teachings on impermanence,
suffering and emptiness, but then proceed to talk about this in
highly content-centered terms. They may say things like, “Oh, yes,
I am impermanent and will die one day. This is awful and this thought
causes me suffering. Truly, I feel empty inside.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is macroscopic,
about grand yet crude concepts and ideas, and so is still squarely in
the territory of philosophy and existentialism. This meditator not
only needs to learn what insight practice actually is, but might also
benefit from a bit more sunshine and exercise or perhaps even some of
those new anti-depressants. A very small amount of such reflection
can be of some limited benefit if the energy of the frustration is
directed into practice. There are other types of reflection that
might be much more skillful, but those are largely a topic for
another day (see Jack Kornfield’s <u>A</u> <u>Path</u> <u>with</u>
<u>Heart</u> or Christopher Titmuss’ <u>Light</u> <u>on</u>&nbsp;
<u>Enlightenment</u>). If meditators would actually just go
microscopic and try to see the Three Characteristics of each and
every individual little sensation that makes up their experience,
then they might begin to actually understand reality at the level
that makes the difference. Effectively encouraging students to shift
their attention from fixation on content and the macroscopic to also
including the microscopic and universal is probably the hardest job
of the meditation teacher. I sometimes wonder how many of them have
largely given up trying to do this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When meditators on
retreat focus on content instead of grounding the mind in the objects
of meditation (which just might produce the deep insights that will
make the big difference that they are looking for), they basically
let their minds go, and go they do. After a day or two of silence and
a nearly complete lack of distractions, the spinning of their minds
on neurotic content may have accelerated like the turbine of a jet
engine on full throttle. If they were a mess before, now this has
been multiplied by a factor of 10 to 100. They then hit the small
group meeting like a runaway freight train of exacerbated mind noise,
and all present get to be bathed in the profound lack of clarity that
they have spent so much hard cushion time cultivating.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Years go by, and
their practice deepens, not into insight territory, but into
epoxy-like faith and further fixation on content. They learn how to
“talk Buddhist.” They learn the “culture” of Buddhism in just
the same way that they learned the culture of transpersonal therapy,
transactional analysis or French existentialism. They become
fascinated with their growing knowledge of Pali, their fancy brass
bell from Nepal, or their knowledge of Tantric iconography. They have
taken Bodhisattva vows 108 times.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They may become
neurotic about “right speech” and self-righteous about “Noble
Silence.” They may begin to adopt the gently condescending and
overly deliberate speech patterns and mannerisms that quietly scream,
“I am sooooo spiritual and aware!” They may become fixated on
complex, arbitrary, restrictive and even disempowering models of what
is “proper Buddhist behavior,” trying to be a “good Buddhist,”
whatever that is. In short, they become very religious. At worst,
they become gaudy and distorted caricatures of the spiritual life.
Such people are generally very tiring to be around. They may even get
sucked into the all too common trap of praying for a “better
rebirth” and “making merit” rather than actually trying to
master the art of meditation and wise living here and now. In short,
the trappings, dogma and scene become everything, and penetrating the
illusions that bind them on the wheel of suffering is lost in the
shuffle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">At its worst, they
can go on like this for enough time so that they develop quite a
retreat resume but little or no insight, and then get caught by this.
They have been to India, sat with this teacher and that teacher, had
Tantric initiations, or been sitting for twenty years. They begin to
become fascinated by all of this and somehow they begin to feel
“wise” despite the fact that they may have no insight whatsoever
into the universal truth of things because they never actually
learned insight practice. They use the word “emptiness” in casual
conversation when they don’t have Clue One what it means. But they
feel they do, as they have spent so much time hearing it,
“meditating” on it, and being spiritual. They talk about “letting
go” and “mindfulness” as if they are the experts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They may even begin
to teach, and to do so they find themselves having to subtly or
overtly rationalize that they completely understand what they are
teaching. After all, they want to encourage faith in their beautiful
tradition, and so try to appear clear and unconfused. They get stuck
here, stuck in the muck of their rationalizations, the misapplied
lingo, the sugarcoated dogma, the role of teacher, and the cultural
trappings that they have become experts in. From this point it can
become nearly impossible for them to actually learn anything, as they
are now trapped in the very teachings that were originally designed
to free them from just such a situation.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5518_1179888903"></a><a name="15__WHAT_WENT_WRONG"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_42"></a>
15. WHAT WENT WRONG? *</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">How did this happen?
How did they substitute knowledge of culture, content and dogma for
fundamental insight? A large number of such people are quite
intelligent. Many have successful careers or graduate degrees. Most
of the big name teachers they sat with probably had some insight and
may have been highly enlightened. So what happened? I can only
speculate, but perhaps something good will come of such speculation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It could just be
that they are into spiritual scenes, trappings, and the like. That is
what they went looking for, and they found it in dizzying abundance.
It could be that they had no idea what they were getting into or what
they wanted, and so they ended up becoming fascinated with these
things simply out of cultural inertia, as many around them will
likely have done so.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">An old friend and
former meditation teacher of mine and I were ranting in our typically
passionate style about this very topic one day, and we came up with
the “Mushroom Theory.” Mushrooms are fed manure and kept in the
dark, and we speculated that part of the problem was that some
meditation teachers were using the “mushroom method” of teaching,
thus raising a crop of “mushroom meditators,” all soft and pale.
This is actually a bit of an extreme way to describe the situation,
and is not meant to imply that the teachers were being malicious.
However, there is this cultural factor in Western Buddhism that real
insight, insight into the fundamental nature of reality or the Three
Characteristics, is almost never talked about directly, unlike in
Burma or some other settings. My friend and I called this cultural
factor the “Mushroom Factor.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, most teachers
won’t say something as blatant as, “Well, when I was meditating,
I spent some period of time lost in the stories and tape loops of my
mind. This was terrible and I got nowhere but nutty. However, one day
a senior teacher straightened me out and somehow convinced me to
ground my mind in the specific sensations that make up the objects of
meditation and examine impermanence. After some days of consistent
and diligent practice using good technique, I began to directly
penetrate the three illusions of permanence, satisfactoriness and
self, and my world began to be broken down into the mind moments and
vibrations that I always thought were just talk. By paying careful
attention to bare phenomena arising and passing quick moment after
quick moment, I progressively moved through the stages of insight and
got my first taste of enlightenment. Thus, if you spin in content and
don’t penetrate the three illusions, you are wasting your time and
mine. This is just the way it is. If you develop strong concentration
on the primary object and investigate the Three Characteristics
consistently, this will almost certainly produce insight. This is
just the way it is. Any questions?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Most meditation
teachers won’t say this, and there are some reasons why. First,
they may not wish to alienate their student base. One reason for this
may come from the teacher hoping that if students are led into this
gently and with great tolerance for their gross misinterpretations of
the practice and teachings then they may be able to persevere.
Another possible reason may have to do with the fact that making a
living as a dharma teacher can be tough, and more students means more
donations. In short, the reality of what practice really is and
entails doesn’t tend to sell well despite the potential for
extraordinary benefits, as students tend to like their delusions and
fascinations more than they realize.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Teachers may also
want to hold back the details of what real insight is like so that
they can more accurately evaluate students’ practice without having
to worry about students rationalizing that they are experiencing
whatever it is the teacher is talking about. Disclosure of the
details of what insight is actually like can result in students
giving spurious reports in interviews either out of their own
confusion or a genuine desire to fool the teacher and make themselves
look good.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These situations
definitely happen, but probably not nearly as often as people
completely missing the boat on what is insight practice and what is
just wallowing in the muck of their mind and perhaps becoming even
more neurotic about it. Thus, my friend and I decided that we would
talk about insight, our practice, and this sort of thing when we
taught. It turns out that doing this is harder than it would seem.
Some hints about why we generally failed to completely live up to our
own ideals will be given later in the chapter called More on the
“Mushroom Factor”. However, we have both done our best to fight
the trend and talk about the stages of insight and what is possible
on the spiritual path.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another possible
reason why people don’t learn to actually practice correctly is
that many people are not on retreat or in the meditation class to
learn what the teachers have to teach. This may be for a variety of
reasons. Perhaps they are just there to find something else, such as
time away from some situation, but are not there to find what the
teachers are teaching. Some students may have so much invested in
their level of education and high position that they just can’t
hear what the teachers are talking about, or they hear it and think,
“Oh, yes, I myself have read many books and fully understand that
trivial little point about impermanence, but when do we get to
enlightenment?” Yikes!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some students may be
there to further their psychotherapy, which can be a fine and worthy
goal. However, they may assume that the meditation teacher is
probably the best psychotherapist they could have. They may think,
“After all, they are enlightened, aren’t they? They must be
completely sane and balanced. They must know about how to have the
perfect relationship, how to find the perfect job, how to invest in
the stock market, how to talk to their mother, how to end world
hunger, how to rebuild a carburetor, and all other such details of
wise living on this Earth. After all, isn’t enlightenment about
understanding everything?” Gadzooks!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A quick digression
here: enlightenment is about understanding the fundamental nature of
all things, and what they happen to be is ultimately completely and
utterly irrelevant to enlightenment. Thus, very enlightened beings
understand something fundamental about whatever arises or however
their lives manifest, i.e. its impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and
emptiness, as well as all of the stuff about the True Self, which is
the same thing and will be discussed later. However, they have no
more knowledge about the specifics of the world, i.e. content or
subject matter, than they have acquired in just the way that anyone
else acquires knowledge about the specifics of this world. They can
even have all sorts of psychological baggage to deal with, and this
is probably the norm.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Enlightened beings
will know a lot about the territory of insight, having had to
navigate it to get enlightened, but this is a strangely specialized
skill and a fairly esoteric body of knowledge that is only really
useful in helping others navigate it. True, being enlightened does
provide by degrees deeper levels of extreme clarity into the workings
of the mind, and this can be helpful. By understanding their own
mind, they will have some level of insight into the basics of the
minds of others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, unless the
meditation teacher is a trained psychotherapist, they are not a
psychotherapist and probably shouldn’t pretend to be one, though
this unfortunately happens far too often in my humble opinion. Just
so, a trained psychotherapist is not enlightened unless they get
enlightened and shouldn’t pretend to understand insight practice if
they don’t. This also happens far too often if you ask me, and the
dark irony is that they tend to charge much more than real, qualified
dharma teachers. (Note: the Buddha was quite adamant about no one
charging for the teachings, which are considered priceless. This
system of nonobligatory donation and mutual support has worked quite
well for 2,500 years, and it would be a tragic mistake to assume that
it cannot function in the West.)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Using retreats or
meditation purely as a form of continuing psychotherapy may have
other problems associated with it. One may not be in the guidance of
a trained therapist and may not be used to the mind noise
amplification factor that silence and a lack of distractions tend to
create in an absence of grounding the mind in a meditation object.
Further, one may not gain the benefits of the only thing that does
make a permanent difference in ending fundamental suffering and
bringing the quiet joy of understanding: mastering insight practice
and getting enlightened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another quick
digression here: there is this odd idea that somehow a lack of effort
is a good thing, or that it is bad to want to get enlightened. This
is completely absurd and has paralyzed the practice of far too many.
I believe this has come from an extremely confused misunderstanding
of Zen or the Bodhisattva Vow. No one ever got enlightened without
effort. This never happened and never will happen. Anyone who has
really gotten into Zen or Mahayana teachings will know firsthand that
they both require a tremendous amount of effort just like every other
spiritual path. As one of my teacher’s teachers put it, “In the
end, you must give up even the desire for enlightenment, but not too
soon!” Sutta #131 in <u>The</u> <u>Middle</u> <u>Length</u>
<u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>&nbsp; <u>Buddha</u> is called
“One Fortunate Attachment,” and in it the Buddha clearly states
that making effort to realize the truth of your experience is an
extremely good idea. He also goes on and on about the Three
Characteristics; funny that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another reason that
students often fail to make progress is that they confuse content and
insight. I suspect that they are confused because they have spent
their whole lives thinking about content, learning about content, and
dealing with content in a context where content matters, i.e. when
one is not doing insight practice. You can’t take a spelling test
in first grade and say that all that is important is that words come
and go, don’t satisfy and aren’t you. This just won’t fly and
wouldn’t be appropriate. Just so, when practicing morality, the
first and most fundamental training in spirituality, content is
everything, or at least as far as training in morality can take you.
You can’t be a mass murderer and rationalize this by thinking,
“Well, they were all impermanent, unsatisfactory and empty, so why
not kill ’em?” This just won’t fly either, and so content and
spirituality get quite connected. This is good to a point: see the
chapter called Right Thought and The Aegean Stables.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Fixation on content
even works well when practicing the second training, training in
concentration. When meditation students are learning to concentrate,
they are told to concentrate on specific things, like the breath, a
Green Tara (a tantric “deity”), or some other such thing. This is
content. There is no such thing as the breath or a Green Tara from
the point of view of insight practices, as these are just fresh
streams of impermanent and absolutely transitory sensations that are
crudely labeled “breath” or “Green Tara.” But for the purpose
of developing the second training, concentration, this is ignored and
these impermanent sensations are crudely labeled “breath” or
“Green Tara.” Thus, even for pure concentration practice, what
you are concentrating on, i.e. content, matters. Thus, the idea that
content is everything is reinforced.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, when it
comes to insight practice, content will get you nowhere fast. In
insight practice, everything the student has learned about being lost
in the names of things and thoughts about them, i.e. content, will be
completely useless and an impediment. Here the inquiry must turn to
impermanence, suffering and no-self. These characteristics must be
understood clearly and directly in whatever sensations arise, be they
beautiful, ugly, helpful, not helpful, skillful, not skillful, holy,
profane, dull, or otherwise. Anything other than this is just not
insight practice, never was and never will be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It doesn’t matter
what the quality of your mind is, or what the sensations of your body
are, if you directly understand the momentary sensations that make
these up to be impermanent, unsatisfactory and not self, then you are
on the right path, the path of liberating insight. However, as
mentioned before, off the cushion the quality of your mind, your
reactions, your words and deeds all matter. These are not in
conflict. Insight practice is about ultimate reality, the ultimate
nature of reality, and thus the specifics don’t matter. Morality
and concentration are about relative reality, and thus the specifics
are everything. Learning to be a master of both the ultimate and the
relative is what this is all about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another reason that
people don’t make progress is that they may be being taught by
people who have no or little insight, and so are taught by those who
are themselves fascinated by content and unskilled in going beyond
this into insight practices. The scary truth is that there are far
more people teaching insight meditation that don’t know what
insight is than those that do, though this tends to be less true in
big, established retreat centers. Thus, even if the students learn
what they are taught, if those who do not know are teaching them,
then what they learn is unlikely to be correct or helpful. While the
teacher may have learned to parrot the language of ultimate reality,
this is absolutely no substitute for direct knowledge of it. In the
tradition I come from, they consider the second stage of
enlightenment (Second Path, see Part III) to generally be the minimum
level of understanding for a teacher. This is a very reasonable
standard.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another possible
reason that people get lost and don’t follow the clear and basic
instructions of insight practices is that they just can’t believe
that doing something as completely simple as looking into the
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and emptiness of the mundane
sensations that make up their ordinary world could produce awakening.
It just sounds ridiculous to them, and thus they imagine that there
are secret teachings somewhere that are the real way to
enlightenment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, they may not
try at all, may practice in their “own way,” or may keep trying
to read more into the teachings than is there and come up with their
own special nonsense. These unhelpful ways of speculating can become
very engaging, but they won’t produce insight. These speculations
can also lead to people trying to do very advanced practices that
were originally designed for meditators that had already mastered
concentration and insight practices to a pronounced degree (such as
intensive Tantric retreats), and thus not deriving the full benefit
from them or running into other problems.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">How do I know that
solely content-based practice won’t produce insight? Because there
are only Three Doors to ultimate reality, that’s why, and they are
utterly unrelated to content, though they can be found in all content
if the content aspect is ignored. (Actually, there is sort of a
fourth door that is accessible to very realized beings, see the
Appendix.) “Only Three Doors? But there are thousands of practices,
many traditions! How can you say there are only Three Doors?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are only Three
Doors, that’s how. I don’t care what tradition you subscribe to,
what practice you do, or who you are, there are only three basic ways
to enter into the attainment of ultimate reality, emptiness, Nirvana,
or whatever you want to call it. These doors relate directly to
profound and direct understandings of the Three Characteristics of
impermanence, suffering and no-self, and you have to understand the
heck out of these to enter into the ranks of the Noble Ones.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“But there are
many valid traditions that do not talk about the Three
Characteristics!” It may appear so, but if the tradition is a valid
tradition you will find these teachings in there somehow, in some
other language or formulation, as these are the only way. You will
find them in the works of Rumi, Kabir and Krishnamurti. You will find
them in the Bible and Koran. You will find them in the writings of
St. John of the Cross and many other Christian mystics. You will find
them in all of the branches of Buddhism. You will find them in the
Upanishads. You will find them in the writings of Carlos Castaneda.
You will find them wherever you find a true spiritual path, and that
is just all there is to it. It can help to consider that to
completely understand compassion is to understand suffering and vice
versa, as these are really two sides of the same coin. Also, to
understand True Self practices is the same as understanding no-self
practices, as these are also two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“But we are
tantric practitioners, and the Three Characteristics are merely a
low-brow Hinayana teaching.” Tantra primarily cultivates the
emptiness door, that of no-self, which is one of the Three
Characteristics. It can also be useful for transmuting energy into
more skillful forms, a bit of which will be discussed later. However,
those who consider themselves to be mahayanists or vajrayanaists
should read the fine print. You will find that all Three
Characteristics are there, and in fact that you are highly encouraged
to master the “Hinayana” practices before moving on to the
Mahayana or Vajrayana practices anyway. I strongly suggest checking
out Lama Yeshe’s <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>Tantra</u>.
Further, the Hinayana is often confused with the Theravada, and while
there are similarities, the Theravada is much more extensive than the
Tibetan division of the Hinayana and contains extensive teachings on
compassion and emptiness as well as helping others, but this is a
topic for another time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In short, should you
enter ultimate reality or emptiness, it will be through one of the
Three Doors. This is just the way it is. It is not negotiable. The
nature of the mind and reality are just the nature of the mind and
reality. You cannot change this, but you can understand it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“But we are Zen
students. We realize Buddha Nature! We don’t need the Three
Characteristics, as we sit zazen!” Read any good book on Zen, such
as those by Dogen, Chi-nul, or the excellent <u>Zen</u> <u>Mind</u>,&nbsp;
<u>Beginner’s</u> <u>Mind</u>, by Shunryu Suzuki. The Three
Characteristics are in there in abundance, and those who think they
can enter ultimate reality in some other way are fooling themselves.
<i>Paying</i> <i>direct</i> <i>attention</i> <i>to</i> <i>bare</i>
<i>reality</i> <i>with</i> <i>clarity</i> <i>and</i> <i>precision</i>
<i>will</i> <i>result</i> <i>in</i> <i>directly</i> <i>observing</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Three</i> <i>Characteristics</i> <i>regardless</i> <i>of</i>
<i>whether</i> <i>or</i> <i>not</i> <i>you</i> <i>wish</i> <i>to</i>
<i>call</i> <i>them</i> <i>that</i>, as they are absolutely the truth
of all conditioned things in all times and in all beings. Thus, the
practice, tradition, and all of that, i.e. content, are irrelevant in
the end. However, you need them right up until the last moment, so
don’t think that I am advocating not following a tradition. I am
just advocating actually following the tradition correctly and thus
clearly penetrating into the nature of your actual experience just as
it is. Nothing helps in the end but understanding the fundamental
nature of reality, i.e. the Three Characteristics.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It may often be true
that people simply are not in a position where insight practices are
appropriate for them. Insight practices are not for everyone. One of
the clear marks of whether or not they are&nbsp; ppropriate for
someone is their ability to even do them in the first place. If
despite clear instructions and appropriate support a would-be insight
meditator is simply unable to do anything but spin in content and
fixation, they should try something else until such time as they can
hear, understand and then follow the extremely basic but specific
instructions of insight practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The last and perhaps
most pernicious of the reasons that students don’t really apply
themselves is that they don’t actually believe it can be done, that
they could actually get enlightened or that anyone else except a rare
few get enlightened. Further, if they do know of an potentially
enlightened person, such as a lineaged teacher, that person typically
becomes thought of as being “other,” an aberration, one of “those
over there,” one of the chosen ones, and somehow surreal, like an
imagined demi-god.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This has been a
terrible problem since the very beginning of all mystical traditions,
and is unfortunately unlikely to go away any time soon. Part of this
is due to the “Mushroom Factor,” but there are many other complex
reasons for it. Suffice to say, it can be done and is done today by
students using these simple practices. Find someone enlightened who
is willing to talk more about this if you want specific examples, and
see the chapter called More on the “Mushroom Factor.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5520_1179888903"></a><a name="16__A_CLEAR_GOAL"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_43"></a>
16. A CLEAR GOAL</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Many of the possible
reasons for why people can get so into “Buddhism” in every way
except clear, well-defined, focused and precise practice are directly
related to a lack of a clear goal. If you have no clear idea of what
you want or why you are doing something, then the results are likely
to be just as murky, vague, and fragmented. Why are you doing all of
this? This is a very important question.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">People may wish to
go on a retreat and have the whole thing be relaxing and blissful.
This can actually be attained temporarily if they then gain some
mastery of concentration practices, though their clarity will almost
certainly shatter the instant they leave the retreat, as
concentration practices produce no long-term stability on their own.
However, they may think that they wish to get enlightened by doing
insight practices. Insight practices involve hard work and clear,
non-anesthetized examination of suffering, among other things. Thus,
these two goals of maintaining bliss and developing insight
simultaneously are in direct conflict, and the student’s practice
will surely be conflicted. This is just one of many possible
examples.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Having a clear goal
is absolutely fundamental to the practice in more ways than may be
initially obvious. In fact, if you understood your actual reality
right now clearly enough to get to the root of why you were doing all
of this and where all this motion of mind comes from, you would be
highly realized. You would penetrate to the heart of compassion and
suffering, of ignorance and emptiness, and be finally free.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I do not write this
lightly. It is completely vital that your motivation be as clearly
understood as possible as it actually is and that all of its energy
be channeled into realizing you goals. Wishy-washy practice brings
wishy-washy results, and determined, well-guided, brave, and
wholehearted practice may bring the desired results.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Knowing what is
possible helps, i.e. what each of the trainings can and cannot
accomplish. I will spell out the details of such things in Part III.
The specifics of our goal may change with time as we become more
familiar with the realities of these, but the core motivation for all
of this never changes. That is quite a statement, given that all
things are impermanent, and about as big a hint as can be given.
Whatever ultimate truth you want on the spiritual path is to be found
in the sensations of the wanting itself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, don’t look
out there except to find wise guidance about how to look inward, for
what you are looking for is “nearer than near.” It is in the
looking. It is in the motivation. It is in the suffering, which is
why this was the First Noble Truth that the Buddha taught. He went
right for the heart of the thing. It is in the question itself, which
is why koan training can work. The experience of the question
contains the answer to the content of the question. It is in the
undying love that drives our every wish for happiness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Strangely, the
process of creating the illusory sense of a self arises out of
compassion, but confused compassion, which is desire. This may sound
odd, but it is as if there was an eddy in reality that befuddled
empty and compassionate awareness, which is not a thing nor separate
from things. Thus, somehow it seems that there is something to
defend, some separate self that must be protected. Thus, out of
confused compassion, barriers and defense mechanisms continue to be
erected to defend this territory, this illusion of a separate self.
Spiritual practices are designed to systematically debunk this
illusion and penetrate these barriers by providing clarity, whereas
all of the traditions can easily become part of these barriers,
cultures to defend, knowledge to assume is self or owned by self, and
that sort of thing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is as if reality
got caught in an unfortunate loop, and this is what we have to work
with, as this loop of illusory duality thinks it is us. The natural
tendency, given “our” lack of clarity, is to continue to defend
this “self” out of compassion and a lack of understanding that
there never was such a thing. This defense and identification is the
process of ego. Interestingly enough, all of the phenomena that make
up this process, i.e. all of the “defilements,” are themselves
empty, intrinsically luminous and non-dual, though they seem
otherwise by their own contrivance. Teachings such as “you are
already enlightened, but you have yet to realize it” point to this
(see <u>Moon</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>Dewdrop</u>, <u>The</u>
<u>Writings</u> <u>of</u> <u>Zen</u>&nbsp; <u>Master</u> <u>Dogen</u>,
edited by Kazuaki Tanahashi, for a particularly profound discussion
of the uses of this dangerous point of view). Thus, realization is
not something created but instead is discovered as being an intrinsic
aspect of phenomena. Thus, with enough stability and clarity
(concentration and wisdom), this natural, compassionate process of
manifestation can begin to function more skillfully, as it has better
information to go on, and can begin to see that creating the illusion
of a separate, permanent self was not at all helpful (though it
seemed to be). At this point, “it” will then let go of the
illusion it has been perpetuating and return to understanding its
natural state, which is freedom and non-duality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is something
that absolutely cannot be accomplished by an act of will. It only
arises when the level of clarity is high enough and the heart
accepting enough of things as they are. One might say that Grace
favors the well-trained mind. The pronounced tenaciousness of this
process of defending an illusory and arbitrary “self”
demonstrates clearly just how much compassion and how much confusion
there is in this. Work to see clearly so that the knot may begin to
untie itself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I include all of
this in the section called “A Clear Goal” because the very sense
of a drive to find something is actually the thing it is seeking. The
motivation is looking for itself. In those sensations themselves is
something very powerful and amazing. However, in order to see this, a
shift has to happen in which the drive becomes driven to understand
the sensations of that drive itself rather than looking to future
sensations for satisfaction. This is a completely unintuitive thing
to do, and this is one reason why meditation practices can seem so
awkward sometimes. However, the fact that the drive or the goal
contains its own solution is the reason why there is such relentless
emphasis on being present to what is happening now. If we can get
this drive to just chill on its future fixation and simply understand
itself, insight is close at hand.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you feel
frustrated that your practice has not been as energized or as clear
as you wish it to be, first sit with the fullness of that wish, with
the fullness of that frustration, with the fullness of your fears,
with the fullness of your hopes, with the fullness of that suffering
and compassion, as clearly and bravely as you possibly can until you
understand them to their very depths as they actually are. Channel
all of this energy into clear, precise, kind and focused living and
practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Since this whole
book is clearly goal-oriented, I thought that it would be appropriate
to add a few guidelines about formulating specific goals and working
towards mastery that can help reduce the problems that poorly
conceived goals can cause. Goals tend to involve a heavy future
component. The trick is to add a component that relates to the Here
and Now as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, one
could wish to become enlightened. This is a purely future-oriented
goal. One could also wish to understand the true nature of the
sensations that make up one’s world so clearly that one becomes
enlightened. This adds a present component and thus makes the whole
thing much more reasonable and workable. One could simply wish to
deeply understand the true nature of the sensations that make up
one’s world as they arise in that practice session or during that
day. This is a very immediate and present-oriented goal, and a very
fine one indeed. It is also <i>method</i>-<i>oriented</i> <i>rather</i>
<i>than</i> <i>result</i>-<i>oriented</i>. This is the mark of a good
goal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Similarly, one could
try to be kind, honest or generous that day, try to appreciate
interdependence that day, or try to stay really concentrated on some
object for that practice session. These present and method-oriented
goals are the foundation upon which great practice is based. Purely
future-oriented goals are at best mostly worthless and at worst very
dangerous.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Wishing to become
enlightened or more enlightened is only helpful if it helps one live
in the present as it is. The same goes for training in morality and
concentration, as articulated in Part I. A good friend of mine once
forgot these basic rules of goal-oriented practice and strived with
great energy for months to attain a goal that had nothing to do with
the reality that he was experiencing at that time. The results were
disastrous and the dark consequences of his error ring on to this
day. Don’t get burned by the shadow side of goal-oriented practice.
Avoid competition and comparing your practice to others. Stay
present-oriented whenever possible, and <i>always</i> <i>avoid</i>
<i>purely</i> <i>future</i>-<i>oriented</i> <i>or</i>
<i>results</i>-<i>oriented</i> <i>goals</i>! Also, be careful what
you ask for. You just might get it but with a price you could never
have imagined.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It should be noted
that thoughts of the past and future occur now. These sensations are
worthy of investigation. “Future mind” is only a problem if the
sensations that make it up are not understood as they are. A fun
practice to try is consciously thinking thoughts whose content is
past- or future-oriented and noticing that they occur now. There is
something particularly profound about this that might be missed on
first inspection.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While I am on the
subject of goal-oriented practice, I should say a few words about how
to avoid overdoing it. First, if those around you, particularly those
with a lot of experience in meditation and the spiritual life, are
telling you that you should chill out a bit, they are probably saying
it for good reason. Ask them why they think that and take their
opinions into consideration. Now, it is true that sometimes people
will tell you to chill out on your practice a bit just because of
their own envy of your determination and diligence, but I haven’t
found this to be a common occurrence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When on intensive
retreats, there are a few basic ways to sail a bit too far out there
too fast. The first is to stop eating. It is true that there is a
long and glorious tradition of people fasting when doing spiritual
practice, but generally they do so because they want to bring on
severely altered states of consciousness. Fasting when meditating is
an effective technique for doing this. Should you be doing insight
practices, altered states are not your intended focus, and so these
are more likely to be distracting than helpful. Further, severely
altered states of consciousness can sometimes be very disruptive and
hard to process, leading to what might be considered by some to be
temporary insanity. If you are the sort of person who would drop LSD
when out in public, then the altered states that fasting might bring
on would probably not be a problem for you. On the other hand, if you
are on retreat with other people, consideration for the fact that
they may not want to deal with the potential side effects of your
vision-quest is warranted.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another way to go
way out on the edge is to stop sleeping. Sleep deprivation can
eventually lead to very altered states of consciousness and visionary
experiences. The exact same considerations that come into play with
not eating apply. While it may be true that when doing intensive
practice the need for sleep may go down to perhaps 4-6 hours or
sometimes less, try to get at least some sleep every night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are those that
are such macho meditators that they will try to sit for very long
periods of time, say 10 to 24 hours. While this might seem like a
really brave thing to do, a real tribute to one’s determination, I
don’t see the point. I have managed to make very rapid progress
when on intensive retreats where the longest sit I did was 4 hours
and most were less than 1.5 hours. However, if one sits long enough
and really pushes the investigation with heroic effort, one can get
into states of consciousness that are quite volatile. It can be very
difficult to ground back down and integrate what comes out of that
sort of extreme practice. Again, out of consideration for your mind
and body, as well as for those around you on retreat who may not want
to deal with your potential inability to integrate and control the
energy that can be generated from that sort of practice, consider
moderation in sitting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Lastly, there are
some who will try to mix mind-altering substances and meditation.
This can seem like an easy and fast path. In fact, there are
countless traditions that use these as an integral part of their
path. However, there are numerous strong warnings against doing this
at all or against doing this without the guidance of those that
really know what they are doing and when not in the proper setting
(e.g. far out in the desert with no one around except a friend to
keep you safe and no big cliffs or weapons nearby). I have found that
simply doing really consistent insight or concentration practices
well can quickly produce altered states and strange experiences that
have taken me to the very brink of what I could handle skillfully and
sometimes beyond, many of which I will discuss in Part III, so I
don’t see the need for using mind altering substances. Further,
there are reasons to learn to see things from different points of
view on our own power so that these things may become a part of who
and what we are rather than some transient side effect brought on by
tinkering with our neurochemistry.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In short, those on
the path of heroic effort can easily get side tracked into
ritualistic displays that seem like heroic effort, but they are not.
Heroic effort on the insight path means heroic investigation of the
Three Characteristics of the sensations that make up our experience,
whatever they may be. Thus, my advice when on an insight meditation
retreat is to really power the investigation all day long, whether
you are sitting, walking, reclining, standing, eating, washing, etc.
Get enough sleep. Eat well to keep up your health. Take care of your
body, particularly your knees and back. Should those with more
experience than you in these matters&nbsp; onsistently tell you to
back off on the effort just a bit, give it a try. I have occasionally
done otherwise and regretted it. William Blake wrote that we do not
know what is enough unless we know what is more than enough.
Unfortunately, most insight meditators will not put forth enough
effort to know either. However, should you find that you are simply
cooking yourself through too much effort, learn from your mistakes
and follow the middle path.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The last point about
having a clear goal I make reluctantly, as I am afraid that I will
justify the very thing I wish to speak out against. Here goes...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I heard someone
speculating that Zen might have developed as being very austere and
drab because of how colorful and unstable Japan was during its
development, and likewise the Tibetan tradition was very colorful and
complex because Tibet was so bleak. Burmese Buddhism might be so
extremely technical, goal-oriented, efficient and effective because
their country is such a chaotic mess. Perhaps in just this way, we
have the most goal-oriented culture in the world and yet tend towards
the least goal-oriented, least practical and least effective take on
Buddhism I have found anywhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is an unfortunate
shadow side of our culture that many of us can barely tolerate one
more goal to attain, one more hoop to jump through, one more exam to
pass, one more certification or degree to obtain, one more SUV to
buy. Perhaps we are crafting a Buddhism in which you don’t have to
really ever accomplish anything so as to find a refuge from our
extremely neurotic fixation on achievement. This might explain why we
often fixate on teachings such as “Effortless effort”, “There
is nothing to attain,” and postponing enlightenment through the
Bodhisattva Vow. Believe me, as someone who has two graduate degrees
and actively involved in a field that requires constant reading,
recertification, and training, I am often sick of the whole
achievement trip as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand, I
have found that goal-oriented practice combined with good instruction
and a few good conceptual frameworks is largely unstoppable barring
extreme circumstances. Thus, if you are sick of goals to the point
that you can’t make any room for those that will soon follow, strip
down your daily life down so as to make room for the drive to master
the states and stages of the path. Take more vacations, back off on
the career-ladder climbing a little, <i>and</i> make time to really
bust out some serious meditative accomplishments. The Buddha was
known for saying that there was nothing so valuable in this world as
mastering the dharma. I couldn’t agree more.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5522_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_44"></a><a name="17__HARNESSING_THE_ENERGY_OF_THE"></a>
17. HARNESSING THE ENERGY OF THE “DEFILEMENTS n</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I am astounded at
how many people are completely paralyzed in their practice because
they feel bad about so many of the types of emotional sensations that
arise. Unrealistic ideals of the emotional perfection that meditation
might bring often create an inability to face one’s actual humanity
or to continue practicing. The energy in “undesirable” emotions
can actually be used to fuel one’s practice, which is good, as this
is much of what we have to work with.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This paralysis
happens because people tend to feel that “bad” emotions should
not arise and are worthless and embarrassing. While there is a lot to
be said for repressing the “defilements,” there is also a lot to
be said for using their tremendous energy in ways that are skillful.
Basically, until we are very enlightened, some odd mixture of
compassion and confusion motivates everything we do, as mentioned
elsewhere, and so we have to learn to work with this. Further, these
potentially useful emotional energies will continue to arise like the
weather, even in very enlightened beings (contrary to popular
belief), so we must learn how to deal with them and use them well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember that these
practices and teachings are not about becoming some kind of
emotionally devoid, non-existent entity, but about clearly
understanding the truth of our humanity and life. Becoming fluent in
the true nature of all categories of sensations, including the
sensations that make up all categories of emotions, is a particularly
good idea and highly recommended. This might even be undertaken as a
systematic practice by those who are dedicated to thorough
understanding. Thus, those doing noting practice, which I highly
recommend, can note which emotions they are feeling, such as fear,
boredom, anger, confidence, restlessness, joy, jealousy, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, if the
powerful energy of the emotional life can be harnessed to energize
our practice, this can be extremely helpful. Some level of skill and
moderation is required here, a middle way between defilement
restraint and energy transmutation. Either extreme can be harmful or
helpful depending on how much wisdom the student has, how good their
teachers are, and how well the student listens to their teachers. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It should be noted
that those who are passionate about practice and learning to actually
practice correctly are much more likely to make progress than those
who are not. Those who are able to channel all their rage,
frustration, lust, greed, despair, confusion and anguish into trying
to find a better way are the only ones who are likely to have what it
takes to finally attain freedom. Those who are actually able to sit
with the specific sensations that make up rage, lust, anger,
confusion and all the rest with clarity, precision, acceptance of
their humanity, and equanimity are even more likely to get
enlightened. This paragraph deserves to be read more than once.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is common for be
people to feel bad about their lack of progress. This can cause them
to feel extremely frustrated, and produce all sorts of self-judgment,
jealousy, extremes of blind faith, and rigid adherence to dogma. It
can paralyze a student’s practice if they get caught in these or in
thinking that desire for enlightenment is a problem when in fact it
is the most compassionate wish that someone could have for themselves
or others. The whole trick is to channel this energy into actual
practice using good technique rather than comparison or thoughts
about progress. Simply examine the sensations that make up all of
this frustration and comparison, i.e. <i>don’t</i> <i>stop</i>
<i>investigating</i> <i>when</i> <i>certain</i> <i>categories</i> <i>of</i>
<i>sensations</i> <i>arise</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Try this little
exercise the next time some kind of strong and seemingly useless or
unskillful emotion arises. First, stabilize precisely on the
sensations that make it up and perhaps even allow these to become
stronger if this helps you to examine them more clearly. Find where
these are in the body, and see as clearly as possible what sorts of
images and story lines are associated with these physical sensations.
Be absolutely clear about the full magnitude of the suffering in
these, how long each lasts, that these sensations are observed and
not particularly in one’s control.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, find the
compassion in it. Take a minute or two (no more) to reflect on why
this particular pattern of sensations seems to be of some use even
though it may not seem completely useful in its current form. Is
there a wish for yourself or others to be happy in these sensations?
Is there a wish for the world to be a better place? Is there a wish
for someone to understand something important? Is there a wish for
things to be better than they are? Is there a wish to find pleasure,
tranquility, or the end of suffering? Sit with these questions, with
the sensations that make them up, allowing them to be strong enough
for to see what is going on but not so strong that you become
completely overwhelmed by them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Notice that fear has
in it the desire to protect us or those about whom we care. Anger
wants the world to be happy and work well or for justice to be done.
Frustration comes from the caring sensations of anger being thwarted.
Desire is rooted in the wish to be happy. Judgment comes from the
wish for things to conform to high standards. Sadness comes from the
sense of how good things could be. I could go on like this for a
whole book.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actively reflecting
along these lines, sit with this compassionate wish, acknowledge it,
and feel the compassionate aspect of it. Allow the actual sensations
that seem to be fundamental to wanting to be directly understood as
and where they are. Remember that this same quality of compassion is
in all beings, in all their unskillful and confused attempts to find
happiness and the end of suffering. Sit for a bit with this
reflection as it relates directly to your experience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then, examine the
mental sensations related to the object that you either wish for
(attraction), wish to get away from (aversion), or wish would just be
able to be ignored (ignorance). Examine realistically if this will
fundamentally help yourself and others and if these changes are
within your power to bring about. If so, then plan and act with as
much compassion and kindness as possible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember then that
all the rest of the suffering of that emotional pattern is created by
your mind and its confusion, and vow to channel its force into
developing morality, concentration, and wisdom. Reflection on the
fact that the emotions have unskillful components as well as skillful
ones can give us a more realistic relationship to our hearts, minds
and bodies, and allow us to grow in wisdom and kindness without
blindly shutting ourselves down or chaining ourselves to a wall. From
a certain point of view, we are all doing our best all the time, and
the problem is just that we do not see clearly enough.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a Tibetan
teaching from Tantra called “The Five Buddha Families” or “Five
Sky Dancers” that does a good job of dealing with the wide world of
emotions and their helpful and less than helpful aspects. There is
also a Tibetan teaching called “The Six Realms” that can help as
well. Both of these teachings are too rich and deep to do them
justice here. If you are interested in these fine teachings, you
might check out <u>Journey</u> <u>Without</u> <u>Goal</u>, <u>Cutting</u>
<u>Through</u> <u>Spiritual</u> <u>Materialism</u> and <u>Transcending</u>
<u>Madness</u>, all by Chogyam Trungpa.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It should be noted
that the fundamental rule when applying emotion-derived effort in
practice is to actually put it into practice rather than thoughts
about practice, thoughts about some goal that seems far off, thoughts
about success or failure, thoughts about one’s strengths or
weaknesses, or even thoughts about putting effort into practice.
These traps are all too common, blindly waste the vast power inherent
in our emotional life, and cause rather than reduce difficulties.
Some of us will have to learn the hard way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I remember some time
ago I when I realized that something I thought that I had understood
quite thoroughly was actually only partially understood. I was very
much less than happy with this, and decided to put the fullness of
this compassionate rage into relentless, focused investigation of the
Three Characteristics during whatever periods of time I could find
during my day for doing so. It was only two months later that I came
to understand what I wished to, and I was grateful for the power of
the emotional life and what it can lend to practice. Remember, there
is love and wisdom mixed into even our “worst” emotions. If that
is what we have to work with, let’s use it wisely!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some may then say,
“That is not right motivation! You cannot proceed without right
motivation!” Well, aside from the fact that this simply isn’t
true, such people trap themselves in a Catch 22. To attain this “very
pure” motivation, to use dangerous language, one must understand
what it is that one wants to use this “pure motivation” to
understand. Thus, were we unable to proceed based upon our somewhat
deluded motivations, awakening would be impossible by definition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Luckily, awakening
is possible, and the only tool we have is practice based upon
semi-deluded motivations. I am extremely grateful that this seems to
be sufficient if we are willing to use what we have rather than
fantasizing about some perfect us that doesn’t exist. Without
greed, rage, grandiosity, frustration, insecurity, fear and a host of
other semi-deluded forces, we would hardly budge. We wouldn’t pick
up dharma books, we wouldn’t go on retreats, we wouldn’t deal
with our stuff, and we wouldn’t care at all. But we do care, and so
we forge on. Thank the Metaphorical God for the power of our emotions
and the pain the dark ones cause. They are the gasoline that drives
us on the road to understanding.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5524_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_45"></a><a name="18__RIGHT_THOUGHT_AND_THE_AEGEAN"></a>
18. RIGHT THOUGHT AND THE AEGEAN STABLES</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a lot of
emphasis on “right thought” and suppressing the mental
“defilements” in Buddhism, as well as training in morality,
“right speech” and that sort of thing. As these are agendas for
what happens in our ordinary reality, they are aspects of training in
morality. This emphasis on controlling our thoughts can be helpful
but it has it limits and often causes problems when misunderstood.
When this becomes the predominant thrust of one’s practice and
involves images of self-perfection that deny the basic realities of
human existence and the inevitable dark sides of life, trouble is
basically guaranteed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Buddha did go on
and on about restraining thought, transforming thought, and that sort
of thing. He was making a very important point, but he didn’t stop
there. He also advocated that people go on to cultivate concentration
and then insight, so as to temporarily quiet and then overcome
forever the fundamental delusions that drive our noisy minds. This
same point would apply to psychotherapy: it can be useful, but to
find the end of suffering we must go much deeper.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sutra #20 in <u>The</u>
<u>Middle</u> <u>Length</u> <u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Buddha</u> (great book, by the way) is called “The Removal of
Distracting Thoughts.” In it, Buddha admonished his followers to
deal with unskillful, evil, unwholesome or useless thoughts in the
following ways. First, if the student is paying attention to
something that is causing these unskillful thoughts, then they should
pay attention to something wholesome that does not produce unskillful
thoughts. If this fails, then they should reflect on the danger in
those thoughts and thus try to condition themselves to not think such
thoughts in this way. If this fails, then they should try to forget
those thoughts and not give any attention to them. If this fails,
then they should give attention to quieting the mind and to stilling
these thoughts. If this fails, then the student should bear down with
their full will and “crush mind with mind,” forcing the thoughts
to stop with unremitting and unrestrained effort. He also recommended
the formal concentration practices of loving-kindness, compassion,
sympathetic joy, and equanimity (see <u>Lovingkindness</u>, <u>The</u>&nbsp;
<u>Revolutionary</u> <u>Art</u> <u>of</u> <u>Happiness</u>, by Sharon
Salzberg, or <u>Training</u> <u>the</u>&nbsp; <u>Mind</u>, by Chogyam
Trungpa).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Those familiar with
cognitive restructuring will notice great similarities between this
2,500-year-old approach and more modern techniques. These can help
develop morality and also suppress the hindrances that cause
distraction and poor concentration, as well as begin to create better
mental and personal habits. However, this can have its problems if
not understood in a realistic and clear way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A subtle but
incorrect modification of these techniques can create a large amount
of internal conflict, as can failing to understand the limitations of
such techniques. The subtle modification that is definitely not
recommended but all too common is the following: the student
substitutes feelings of self-judgment or self-loathing for the
thoughts they feel are unskillful. This results from only seeing the
ignorance side and not the compassion side of intentions and
thoughts. It can produce some extremely detrimental results, as well
as highly neurotic and repressed individuals who are in basic denial
of their actual humanity and heart. It can produce students who are
quite bitter, tight, judgmental, Puritanical, and generally
unpleasant to be around. This is one extreme.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The other extreme
tends to come when people only focus on the compassion side of their
emotions and not the confusion and suffering that can be mixed in
with them. Aspects of late 1960s come to mind. This error can lead to
extreme misunderstandings of Tantra, unhealthy Epicureanism,
addictions, and general debauchery that are simply destructive. While
this may seem fun and “liberating” for a while, the consequences
tend to be as bad as would be expected. Thus, a sophisticated
examination of our hearts, desires, aversions and confusions can help
sort out what aspects of these are skillful and worth cultivating and
what aspects are unhelpful and worth abandoning by the various
methods available.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The last problem
comes from not understanding that the only way to really bring some
permanent relief from these persistent and somewhat uncontrollable
thoughts is to get quite enlightened. Until this happens, even in the
early stages of awakening, the “defilements” of the mind will
continue to cause the creation of all kinds of unhelpful thoughts and
mind noise that are easy to get caught in and fooled by. Thus, while
training in thought restraint can be very helpful and is highly
recommended, it should not be viewed as being more powerful than it
is. Remember that training in morality and concentration does not
produce awakening without training in insight. This point is
mentioned again and again, but somehow continues to be overlooked.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A useful analogy is
that of the Aegean Stables. The story goes that one of Hercules’
tasks was to clean the Aegean Stables. These housed a very large
number of horses that continually produced great mounds of excrement.
He tried again and again with superhuman strength to clean them, but
there were too many horses producing too much excrement too fast for
him. As soon as he had cleaned one area, the other areas were full of
manure, and so he despaired. However, when he diverted a great river
through the stables, this was able to wash the whole of the stables
clean at once, and his task was accomplished. While the sensations
that make up our reality are still misunderstood, we can feel a bit
like Hercules before he diverted the river. This is par for the
course and normal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Enlightenment is a
sudden thing, but the cultivation of that initial awakening is a
gradual thing and proceeds in fairly predictable stages (detailed in
Part III). For more information on this topic, I recommend the
excellent works of Chi Nul, presented in <u>Tracing</u> <u>Back</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Radiance</u>&nbsp; as translated by Robert Buswell. At
each progressive stage, certain unhelpful patterns of identification
with experience are forever eliminated or overcome, sort of like
channeling a river through one part of the stables, but many more
remain until final and complete awakening. Thus, the mind becomes
progressively clearer, more spacious and quieter, and those
unskillful thoughts regarding identification that do arise are more
likely to be caught before they can do damage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, those who wish
for the end of suffering should strive to be kind, stabilize the
mind, and carefully and precisely understand the actual truth of
their experience in each moment in a way that goes beyond content.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5526_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_46"></a><a name="19__FROM_CONTENT_TO_INSIGHT"></a>
19. FROM CONTENT TO INSIGHT</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the previous
chapter, I explained a method of cognitive restructuring that was
designed to help us stop thinking distracting or unhelpful thoughts.
As those techniques have an agenda for what happens, rather than an
agenda for perceiving something fundamental about whatever happens,
they are an aspect of training in morality or concentration. However,
if we are willing to realize that we can also take an
insight-oriented perspective on difficult or distracting thoughts,
either on the cushion or when walking around, then we can begin to
make the transition from content to insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As you would expect,
this method is grounded squarely in the Three Characteristics, as
well as the other basic assumptions of insight practices, such as
one’s current sensate experience being the gold standard for
reality. This method is probably best shown by way of examples, in
this case of a few people with a Big Issue who are on an insight
meditation retreat and reporting their experiences to their teacher.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first example is
of someone who is completely buying into the content. “So, in my
practice I have been working through my Big Issue, you know, really
trying to deal with it. It just seems to come back again and again.
Every time I sit on the cushion, I find myself thinking about my Big
Issue again. This Big Issue is such a big part of my life, such a
huge issue. I am afraid that if I look too closely at my Big Issue it
will overwhelm me. I wish my Big Issue would just go away. I have
been doing so much practice, and yet I still have to deal with this
darned Big Issue.” Notice that the person assumes continuity of the
existence of the Big Issue. They also assume that all thoughts about
the Big Issue are either self, the property of self, or separate from
self. Further, they are not working at a sensate level, trying to see
the true nature of the thoughts and physical sensations that make up
the Big Issue and the rest of their reality. In short, the “practice”
they mention is some sort of practice other than insight practice.
Let’s try that again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I sat down on the
cushion, and I had barely begun to practice noticing my breath when a
thought about my Big Issue arose. I tried to ignore it, but then more
thoughts about Big Issue arose, and my stomach began to feel queasy.
I tried to focus on the breath again, but then I found myself
thinking about the Big Issue again, thought after thought, mostly the
same old thoughts repeating again and again.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This person is
already making progress towards using these thoughts and physical
sensations as a basis for insights. They are beginning to try to
apply the assumptions of insight practices to their experience. They
are trying to focus on a physical object, trying to notice the
individual sensations that make up their thoughts and physical
sensations. However, they have poor concentration and have not
learned to see the true nature of the sensations that make these up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I sat down on the
cushion, and I tried to see each of the sensations that make up the
breath. Interspersed with these physical sensations were mental
images of the breath. Interspersed with all of these sensations were
also thoughts about the Big Issue. They were quick and seemed to also
involve some mildly painful or disconcerting physical sensations in
the region of my stomach. I could see these come and go and that they
were observed. I could feel as they arose that there was something
irritating about these quick sensations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I noticed that
most of my experience was made of sensations that didn’t seem to
relate to that Big Issue. Sometimes I noticed the three
characteristics of the sensations that seem to be related to the old
Big Issue pattern of sensations, and sometimes I was able to stay
with the sensations of breathing. However, regardless of which
sensations arose, I was generally able to see some aspect of the true
nature of them. Thus, I find that I am able to keep practicing and
not get lost in old, circular thoughts about that Big Issue that do
me little good and have caused me much pain.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These are the sorts
of descriptions that really light up a meditation teacher’s eyes.
They can see that this is a person who really is getting a sense of
what is insight practice and how it can be useful. The meditator not
only understands the focus and assumptions of insight practices but
are also able to actually do fairly consistent and strong practice.
Even being able to do this when we are walking around and dealing
with our stuff can be helpful. Shifting to the sensate level reveals
things about our stuff that can be very helpful for keeping it in
perspective and not getting overwhelmed by it. It also develops
habits that make it easier for us to shift to a sensate level when we
do formal insight practice. Thus, if you have an issue that keeps
bugging you, try taking the time to see the Three Characteristics of
the sensations that make it up as you go about your day, thinking,
“The pattern of sensations that make up the Big Issue are quick,
transient, and observed. I will do my best to notice this as those
sensations occur. When speaking of the Big Issue to others and to
myself, I will try to keep my descriptions at an insight-oriented
level. By seeing this Big Issue as objective and transient phenomena,
I will not be lost in my negative and painful thoughts about my Big
Issue. I will be able to bring more clarity and spaciousness to the
Big Issue, able to bring more intelligence to the Big Issue, able to
bring more common sense and balance to the Big Issue. If I can do
this, it will be of great benefit to me. If I continue to wallow in
my circular thoughts about my Big Issue that get me nowhere, I will
simply experience unnecessary pain to little good effect. This is my
plan and my resolve. Though I may fail again and again to be able to
do this, eventually I will break the habit of not being able to see
the true nature of the Big Issue and thus will grow in wisdom and
happiness!” That’s the way the game is played.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just for fun, I will
give two more examples from even more advanced practitioners and how
they might describe their practice. “I sat down on the cushion and
began noticing the three characteristics of the sensations that make
up experiential reality showing themselves. There were physical and
mental sensations, all arising and vanishing quickly and
effortlessly. I could see perhaps 5-15 sensations per second,
primarily in the abdominal region, but there were many other little
sensations coming in from all over, colors on the back of my eyelids,
sounds from other meditators breathing. Occasionally, there were some
quick sensations interspersed with these about that Big Issue, like
little phantoms vanishing in a sea of flickering color and form. They
caused no interruptions in my investigations, being just more
sensations for investigation.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is obviously a
strong practitioner with solid insight skills. They know exactly what
they are looking for and do so. They are willing to make time for
bare sensate investigation. We cannot instantly make the transition
to this sort of practice, but I am a firm believer that making clear
exactly what we are looking for can make it much easier to actually
make the transition from content to insight. By observing what we are
able to do and taking a look at what someone at the next higher
skill-level can do, we will be able to proceed with more confidence
that we are on the right track.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This last example is
a description of practice from a particularly strong and advanced
practitioner. “I sat down on the cushion and the cycles of insight
presented themselves effortlessly. There was a shift, and very fine,
fast vibrations arose instantly, dropping down quickly, and then they
shifted out, getting vague for a few seconds. Concentration
restabilized and revealed the quick ending of sensations one after
the other, perhaps 5-10 per second, and then things began thickening
somewhat, getting somewhat irritating, but vibrations remained the
predominant experience. It was just that their unsatisfactory aspect
became more predominant, and there were a few sensations relating to
the Big Issue.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I may have
noticed a few hints of what dualistic perspectives remain and the
basic pain and confusion they cause. There was a shift, and a more
panoramic and easy perspective arose, accompanied by more coherent
and synchronized vibrations including most of sensate reality,
including much of space, at perhaps 5-15 per second. There was a
short period of barely noticeable but mature equanimity in the face
of these as the vibrations became more inclusive. Any sense of
practicing dropped away entirely.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“A minute later,
two of the Three Characteristics presented completely in quick
succession, including the whole background of space, revealing
something incomprehensible in the nature of subject and object, and
reality vanished. Reality reappeared quiet, clear, beautiful and
easy. I solidified space in that afterglow so as to enjoy the
formless realms for a few minutes, rising up through them and back
down to boundless space. A vision relating to the Big Issue arose.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I stabilized on
the vision, noticing the feeling of it, and before I knew it I was
out of body, traveling in a strange realm, having interactions that
replayed the issue of the Big Issue in symbolic or mythic form. I saw
something about this issue that I never had before, how an old,
unexamined and fictitious train of associations lead to my inability
to come to some more balanced understanding of this issue. This
epiphany broke my concentration, and I returned to my body. I then
dropped out of the formless realms, allowing a new insight cycle to
begin again. When I got up off the cushion, I noticed that the
psychological insights that arose in the other realm gave me an
increased sense of humor and a more compassionate perspective towards
those involved in this issue. They were just trying to be happy, just
as we all are. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They have talent and
a wide range of skills. They are not only an advanced insight
practitioner, but they also have strong concentration skills and can
even chance into some of the more unusual concentration attainments.
Further, they even seem to be able to use their ability to travel out
of body to gain relative insights into the content of their stuff.
Last, they are on the look out for the subtle signs of the limits of
their insights. They are not only skilled, but they realize what they
do not yet know. They are well on their way to mastering the core
teachings of the Buddha.</p>

&nbsp;20. CONCENTRATION VS. INSIGHT</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a lot of
confusion on the differences between concentration practices and
insight practices. This may be caused in part by the “Mushroom
Factor,” or may be due in part to other factors, such as
concentration practice being easier than insight practices and
distinctly more pleasant most of the time. Concentration practices
(samatha or samadhi practices) are meditation on a concept, an
aggregate of many transient sensations, whereas insight practice is
meditation on the many transient sensations just as they are. When
doing concentration practices, one purposefully tries to fix or
freeze the mind in a specific state, called an “absorption,”
“jhana” or “dyana.” While reality cannot be frozen in this
way, the illusion of solidity and stability certainly can be
cultivated, and this is concentration practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight practices
are designed to penetrate the Three Illusions of <b>permanence</b> ,
<b>satisfactoriness</b> and <b>separate</b> <b>self</b> so as to
attain freedom. (N.B., the illusion of satisfactoriness has to do
with the false sense that continuing to mentally create the illusion
of a separate, permanent self will be satisfactory or helpful, and is
not referring to some oppressive and fun-denying angst trip). Insight
practices (various types of vipassana, dzogchen, zazen, etc.) lead to
the progressive stages of the progress of insight. Insight practices
tend to be difficult and somewhat disconcerting, as they are designed
to deconstruct our deluded and much cherished views of the world and
ourselves, though they can sometimes be outrageously blissful for
frustratingly short periods.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Concentration states
are basically always some permutation of great fun, extremely
fascinating, seductive, spacious, blissful, peaceful, spectacular,
etc. There is basically no limit to how interesting concentration
practices can be. Insight practice stages and revelations can also be
very interesting, but are not potentially addictive the way
concentration states and side effects can be. Insight practices tend
to be hard work most of the time even if that work is just
surrendering to things as they are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of the factors
that actually adds to the confusion is that the concentration state
terminology (jhanas) is used in the original texts to describe both
the progressively more sophisticated concentration states and also
the progress of insight, with little delineation of which was which.
This was solved to some degree a few hundred years later when the
stages of the progress of insight were articulated in the canonical
commentaries, but the original problem was not mentioned. It was only
in the second half of the 20th Century that the problem was sorted
out to some degree by the Burmese, and I will delineate the vipassana
jhanas later.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To try to keep this
clear in a way that the old texts simply don’t, whenever I refer to
jhana without mentioning whether I mean samatha or vipassana jhana, I
always mean samatha jhana, a stable state produced by concentration
practices. When I refer to those jhanas produced by insight
practices, I will always call them vipassana jhanas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Concentration
practices develop concentration but they don’t develop wisdom. The
problem is that concentration states can easily fool people into
thinking that they are the end goal of the spiritual path because
these states can become so blissful, spacious, and even formless, and
thus can closely match some imprecise descriptions or expectations of
what awakening might be like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However,
concentration practices can be very helpful and are very important.
Without at least some skill in concentration practices, insight
meditation is virtually impossible. There is an esoteric debate in
the ancient commentaries about some students who got enlightened
without even attaining the lowest of the concentration states (the
first jhana, explained later), practitioners called “dry insight
workers,” but I wouldn’t bank on this being a common occurrence.
Luckily, insight practices themselves can simultaneously develop
concentration and insight, though the dangers of being seduced by
concentration states can lie in wait there as well. In short, you
must master the first jhana as a minimum basis for beginning the
progress of insight, but this is all that is required for
enlightenment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So long as one is
very clear about what is concentration practice and what is insight
practice, which may not be as easy an understanding to come by as
some might think, concentration practice beyond the first jhana can
be helpful to the insight practitioner. All of the concentration
states stabilize the mind, obviously, and this has four primary
benefits. First, just a movie camera that is shaking wildly will not
be likely to produce a clear or intelligible movie, so a mind that
won’t stay settled on an object will not clearly perceive the
ultimate truth of it. Second, as concentration states cultivate deep
clarity and stability on content, they are very useful for promoting
deep and healing psychological insights. Put another way, if you want
to bring up your stuff, do concentration practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Third, concentration
states can be a welcome and valid vacation from stress, providing
periods of very deep relaxation and peace that can be an extremely
important part of a sane, compassionate and healthy lifestyle. The
Buddha highly praised those who had mastery of the concentration
states, and this should serve as a reminder to those who
underestimate their great value or erroneously feel that not enjoying
one’s life is somehow “spiritual.” Fourth, concentration
practices can help the insight practitioner stay somewhat more
mentally stable and balanced as their old concepts of their existence
are rent asunder by insight practice. However, if these states end up
blocking this process by solidifying a sense of self as being
anything or creating aversion to clearly experiencing suffering then
they become a hindrance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is a very
tricky balance. If a student clings to stability or fluidity they
will surely not make progress in insight. However, if they plunge
into the fast and harsh vibratory experiences of insight practice
without the soothing effects of concentration practice to help them
stay somewhat grounded, the student can be a bit like someone who has
taken a small dose (or a big dose in the worst cases) of LSD or drunk
way too much coffee. I spent the first five years of my practice
giving only a moderate amount of attention to the samatha jhanas and
I now realize that this was probably an error.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sometimes spiritual
openings can be extreme and dramatic, and being able to slow things
down and calm down can sometimes be very useful and skillful if we
have to deal with the world and deal with these openings at the same
time. In short, if you want to gunk up your insight practice because
you simply need to slow down so as to be able to get on with your
life or not completely flip out, such as to study for medical school
boards, etc., one way to do this is to indulge in concentration
states. Coupling this with formal resolutions to not make progress in
insight can be very effective. There are many concentration states,
and they become progressively more refined as one masters them. A
brief description of the concentration states follows. It is
basically straight out of the standard texts and very accurate.
Regardless of the tradition you are following, when you begin to get
some mastery of its concentration practices you will go through these
states in this order up to the level of your current ability, though
some people can master skipping over jhanas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The specific object
of meditation may limit the level of jhana that can be attained, as
well as color the experience of these states. Such details are
spelled out in various canonical texts, such as <u>The</u>&nbsp;
<u>Visuddhimagga</u> and the more readable but harder to find
<u>Vimuttimagga</u> . Bhante Gunaratana’s <u>The</u> <u>Jhanas</u>,
included in his more complete work <u>The</u> <u>Path</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Serenity</u> <u>and</u> <u>Insight</u>, is a scholarly work on the
subject, as is Nyanatiloka’s <u>Path</u> <u>to</u> <u>Deliverance</u>
(published by the Buddhist Publication Society out of Sri Lanka).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some of these texts
(particularly the first two) go into long and sophisticated
discussions about which posture and which object might be best suited
to the individual proclivities of various types of people. It is
unfortunate that this sort of information is not in common use today.
I suppose that a suit off the rack will work for most occasions, but
there is something about one that has been tailor made. I am told
that there are still a few monasteries that provide this sort of
traditional training. Unfortunately, this topic is way too complex to
treat properly here, but those of you who are that serious about
these subjects are highly advised to check out the original sources.
They contain an astounding amount of powerful information but
unfortunately make for fairly tedious reading.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Many traditions use
the breath as the primary object initially and then shift to the
qualities of the states themselves as the object of meditation when
they arise and the concentration is strong. The quality of a jhana
can either be “soft” or “hard” depending on how solidly one
is in the state. In soft jhana, the qualities of that particular
state are definitely recognizable in a way that is different from the
ordinary experience of those qualities to the degree that we are
confident we are in the altered state defined by those qualities. In
really hard jhana, it feels as if our mind has been fused to those
qualities and the object with super glue, as if we were nothing but a
solid block or field of those qualities or that object, as if they
and the object were the whole world with nothing else remaining.
Getting into really “hard” jhana states dramatically increases
the beneficial effects of the practice, though it takes greater
strength of concentration and usually requires more favorable
practice conditions to do so. Taking the beneficial factors of the
jhana solely as the object of concentration is helpful for this, as
can be using an easily identified external object such as a candle
flame or colored disk.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For detailed
instructions in practices that use an external object, called
“kasina” practices, the works listed above, particularly Bhante
Gunaratana’s <u>The</u> <u>Path</u> <u>of</u> <u>Serenity</u> <u>and</u>
<u>Insight</u>, provide such a good treatment of them that you should
simply obtain and read those sources. However, the basic instructions
are these: stabilize your concentration on an external object
(kasina) until you can see the object with your eyes closed or when
you are not looking at the object. Take that vision as the new object
and stabilize your attention on it until your concentration is like a
rock. From this foundation, you should be able to easily attain any
of the states I am about to describe.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The basic pattern
one goes through with these states is as follows. First, one develops
enough concentration to attain the jhana. Then the mind sees/feels
the jhana, moves towards and into it, with almost all such state
shifts occurring between the end of the out breath and the beginning
of the new in breath, sometimes accompanied by the eyelids
flickering. Then there is the honeymoon period, where the jhana is
fresh but unsteady. Then there is the maturation period, when the
jhana really comes into its own more solidly and shows its true
glory. Then the faults of the jhana tend to become noticeable, as
well as the proximity of the state to the state below it and the ease
of falling into that lower state. Next, the concentration deepens,
and some sort of equanimity about the good and bad aspects of the
jhana sets in. When the concentration grows strong enough and the
current jhana is no longer desirable, the mind will naturally shift
to the next higher jhana and the cycle goes around again within the
limits of the humanly attainable states and your current skill level</p>

21. THE CONCENTRATION STATES (SAMATHA JHANAS)</h1>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5534_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_FIRST_JHANA"></a>
THE FIRST JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first jhana
arises after the student has gained the ability to actually steady
the mind on some object such as the breath, i.e. after a state called
“access concentration,” meaning the level of concentration needed
to access the first jhana or insight practice. Notice that if we are
spinning lost in thought this is basically impossible. If you wish to
attain this, I would try to stay as completely as possible with an
object for perhaps 1 minute. When you can do this, try for 10
minutes. When you can do this, try for an hour. For instance, if you
were using the breath as an object, try to be aware of every single
breath at least in part for a full ten minutes, and then for an hour.
This is definitely possible, and a reasonable goal. Try not paying
too much attention to the individual sensations themselves, but
conceptualize the breath as a coherent and continuous entity, with
many different types of sensations all being thought of as being the
breath. <i>It</i> <i>is</i> <i>important</i> <i>to</i> <i>know</i>
<i>that</i> <i>really</i> <i>getting</i> <i>into</i> <i>a</i> <i>sense</i>
<i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>breath</i> <i>as</i> <i>a</i> <i>continuous</i>
<i>entity</i> <i>for</i> <i>10</i> <i>seconds</i> <i>will</i> <i>do</i>
<i>you</i> <i>more</i> <i>good</i> <i>than</i> <i>being</i> <i>generally</i>
<i>with</i> <i>the</i> <i>breath</i> <i>on</i> <i>and</i> <i>off</i>
<i>for</i> <i>an</i> <i>hour</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Tune into the
illusory smoothness of things by purposefully and calmly working with
illusions of solidity or fluidity. There is a certain “into it”
quality which helps, sort of like really getting into a slow groove
when playing an instrument, having sex, playing a sport, or just
sinking into a well-deserved and warm bubble bath. Being in a silent
and safe place is very helpful, as is giving yourself permission to
relax, put the cares of the world behind you, and enjoy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you are using the
breath as an object, you might try purposefully visualizing it as
sweet, smooth waves or circles that are peaceful and welcome. Try
breathing as if you were in a garden of fragrant roses and you wish
to experience the fullness of their fragrance. Perhaps these tips
will help illustrate the kind of non-resistant and peaceful presence
that can help one attain these states. Tune into sensations in and
around the primary object that feel good. Harbor no guilt, anxiety or
fear related to the depths of pleasure, ease and well-being. The
spiritual life need not be some sort of relentless, austere grind,
particularly when doing concentration practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As concentration
improves, it is as though the mind “sees” the first jhana and
grabs on to it. Having an idea of what you are looking for, i.e.
something enjoyable and steady, can be helpful for this. It has the
five primary factors of applied and sustained effort or attention,
rapture, happiness and concentration. Thus, it is great fun, feels
good, but takes consistent effort to sustain. The attention is
focused narrowly, as though one were looking at a small area of this
page. This state can be quite a relief from the pain and discomfort
of sitting meditation and can temporarily quiet the mind somewhat. As
with all the concentration states, it is generally quite easy to
concentrate on something that is very enjoyable. Thus, one’s
concentration skills may improve rapidly and easily after attaining
the first jhana and tend to basically flounder until one has attained
the first jhana. <i>Thus</i>, <i>attaining</i> <i>the</i> <i>first</i>
<i>jhana</i> <i>is</i> <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> <i>important</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">People tend to
really like this state, and may cling to it for the rest of the
retreat if on retreat, or cultivate it again and again in their
sitting practice at home. It is a valuable attainment, as it serves
as the minimum foundation for both insight and concentration
practices. From the first jhana there are basically three things a
meditator can do. They can either get stuck there (I know someone who
spent some twenty years cultivating the first jhana in their daily
practice and thinking this was insight practice), they can progress
to the second jhana, or they can investigate the first jhana and thus
begin the progress of insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">By “investigate”
the state, I mean that they can direct their attention to breaking
the illusion of the solidity of that state into its component
individual sensations so that one can understand their true nature,
i.e. the Three Characteristics, as is done in insight practice with
all objects. Special attention must be paid to trying to experience
the precise arising and passing of every individual sensation that
makes up the state, particularly the primary beneficial factors of
the state listed above.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While it is not
actually possible to perceive the arising and passing of every single
sensation or to even be mindful of every sensation, it is definitely
possible to be clear about enough of them to get enlightened, and
that is what matters. It is somewhat common for people to do this
half-heartedly and not pay particular attention to the myriad
sensations that make up rapture and happiness, as they secretly wish
them to be permanent, satisfy and be self or the property of self.
Stagnation is basically guaranteed in insight practice if you cling
to pleasant sensations in this way, or anything else for that matter.
Put another way, if you fail to see the impermanence of objects, you
will have artificially solidified them (“clung to” them) and will
not gain insight from them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The near enemy of
the first samatha jhana is access concentration, and when the applied
and sustained effort or attention flag somewhat, access concentration
sets in. As the texts rightly say, the applied and sustained effort,
i.e. the fact that you have to make effort to get into and stay in
this state, are also somewhat annoying. This becomes more and more
apparent, and clear awareness of just this simple fact while staying
in the jhana causes the mind to eventually bail out of the first
jhana and into the second jhana.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5536_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_SECOND_JHANA"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_50"></a>
THE SECOND JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The second jhana is
like the first, i.e. a seemingly solidified mind state. With the
dropping of almost all of applied and sustained effort the rapture
and happiness factors created by concentration can really
predominate. Thus, whereas the first jhana feels like something you
need to pay attention to, the second jhana has the quality of showing
itself to you. The focus of attention widens out somewhat, sort of
like looking straight ahead without focusing the eyes on anything
specific. Whereas mind-generated objects in the first jhana are
stable, they will move (e.g. spin, pulse, resonate, etc.) in the
second jhana in ways that correlate with the phase of the breath,
moving slowly towards the top and bottom of the breath and more
quickly in the middle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The silence of the
mind is noticeably increased, and the pleasure of this state may
increase greatly as well, particularly if pleasure is the focus of
attention. When this state is really cultivated, the intensity of the
pleasure of this state can become pretty much as strong you can stand
it. Again, this state is a fine attainment but can be quite
captivating. Some may get stuck cultivating this again and again for
some period of time ranging from days to years. Again, the meditator
also has the option to try to go on to the third jhana or to
investigate this state and begin the progress of insight, paying
careful attention to completely deconstructing the state into its
moment-to-moment components.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5538_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_51"></a><a name="THE_THIRD_JHANA"></a>
THE THIRD JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If the meditator
decides to go on to the third jhana, then just&nbsp; ultivating the
second state more deeply and noticing that the rapture or emotional
“wow factor” of that state eventually becomes annoying can cause
the mind to eventually abandon this state and shift into the third
jhana.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In this state, the
rapture drops away, and what is left is more cool “bodily” bliss
and equanimity with a lot of mindfulness of what is going on. (It
must be noted that it is possible to be so deeply into any jhana,
even the first jhana, that the sense of the body is quite vague,
distorted or even entirely absent, so this must be kept in mind when
reading these descriptions.)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The attention is now
in wide focus, sort of like resting in the half of space that is in
front of one’s self. The third jhana is like the counterpoint to
the focus of attention of the second jhana. In the second jhana,
wherever we look we see clearly, whereas in the third jhana the wide
periphery of our attention is clear and the center of our attention
is murky. This can be extremely confusing until one gets used to it,
and trying to stay with one object in the center in the third jhana
will cause the meditator to miss what this state has to offer and
teach. Moving from the second to the third jhana is like going from
focusing on the donut hole to focusing on the outer edge of the
donut, except that now you are sitting in the center of the donut.
Remember this when you get to descriptions of the Dark Night in the
section on the stages of insight, as the Dark Night has as its
foundation the third jhana but adds the Three Characteristics.
Focusing on the wide periphery is a more inclusive, broader, more
sophisticated and complex kind of concentration than the first two
jhanas, like going from listening to Elvis to listening to very
complex, dissonant Jazz.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In its pure and
simple spaciousness, profound clarity, balance and contentment, the
third jhana is even better than the second jhana. It is no wonder
that people can easily mistake these states for enlightenment, as
they can seem to fit the descriptions of what enlightenment might be
like. Remember that enlightenment is not a mind state, nor is it 2
dependent on any condition of reality. It does not come and go as
these states do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, from this
state, the meditator has a few options. They can get stuck, which
definitely happens, they can move on to the fourth jhana, or they can
investigate this state and begin the progress of insight. This would
require extra special attention to make sure that all of the specific
sensations that make up peace, equanimity, bliss and spaciousness are
clearly observed to arise and pass, not satisfy, and not be self or
the property of self.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These qualities are
not easy to let go of, and so this can be difficult. However, upon
leaving such a state, the mind will still have a measure of the good
qualities of the state. This can be useful to insight practice if one
is willing to not cling to such things. This applies to the other
states as well, and this is why many teachers have their students
master concentration states before they move on to insight practice.
On the other hand, such states can be so intoxicating and such a
stagnant dead end for those that become fooled by them that some
teachers have their students avoid them like the plague until they
have some very deep insights into the truth of things.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5540_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_FOURTH_JHANA"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_52"></a>
THE FOURTH JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As before, if the
student wishes to go on to the fourth jhana, then they just cultivate
the third jhana and begin to pay attention to the fact that even the
bodily bliss is somewhat irritating or noisy. Eventually, the mind
will abandon the third jhana and shift into the fourth jhana, which
is the height of equanimity. This state is remarkable in its simple
spaciousness and acceptance. The extreme level of imperturbability
would be astounding if there was not such pronounced
imperturbability. This is by far the most restful of the first four
jhanas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The focus of
attention is now largely panoramic and thus even saying “focus”
here is a bit problematic. In the first jhana the object was finally
clear but static and solid that we can stay with. In the second jhana
the object begins showing itself and some simple motion is allowed.
In the third jhana we go from a spot of attention to a wide circle of
attention and the motion gets more complex, so we now have two
spatial dimensions and time. In the fourth jhana things get
three-dimensional and mind-made objects such as visualizations take
on a life 3 of their own, becoming living, luminous and transparent.
The fourth jhana includes space and awareness in a way that the
previous three do not. Mindfulness is considered to be perfected due
to equanimity, though this factor does not stand out as in the third
jhana. When we are really in this state, the basic sense we have of
where our body is and what it looks like can get very vague or even
vanish entirely, though this is less true if we are in this state
with our eyes open.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is quite a high
attainment, and can easily be confused with the goal of the spiritual
life, though it very much isn’t. From this state the student has
quite a number of options. They can get stuck, they can move on to
the formless realms, they can cultivate what are described as
“psychic powers,” or they can investigate this state and begin
the progress of insight. When investigating this state, special
attention must absolutely be given to the fact that the myriad
sensations that make up equanimity and spaciousness come and go
moment to moment, do not satisfy or provide a permanent resting
place, and are not self.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, it is easy to
get attached to the sensations that make up these high states, and so
great precision and attention (as well as honesty) must be given to
this if the student chooses this option. Another alternative is to
leave this state and then begin insight practice, as the qualities
that this state writes on the mind linger for a short time, and this
can be helpful if the student does not cling to these benefits.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5542_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_53"></a><a name="THE__PSYCHIC_POWERS"></a>
THE “PSYCHIC POWERS”</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As to the “psychic
powers” (“siddhis” in Pali), the texts list all kinds of
special abilities that may be cultivated using the fourth jhana (or
perhaps lower or higher jhanas) as a base, and these are attained
today. These may include all kinds of strange experiences, including
full blown and extremely realistic experiences of other realms that
can seem quite magical and fall quite in line with what one might
think of when one thinks of various “psychic powers.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Whether or not these
are “real” is a question that I am happy to avoid, though these
experiences can be so extremely vivid that they can seem more “real”
than the “real world.” <i>Much</i> <i>more</i> <i>interesting</i>
<i>than</i> <i>the</i> <i>question</i> <i>of</i> <i>what</i> <i>is</i>
<i>real</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>question</i> <i>of</i> <i>what</i>
<i>is</i> <i>causal</i>, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. <i>what</i> <i>leads</i>
<i>to</i> <i>what</i>. For example, we might decide that our dreams
are not “real”, but we must admit that there are real world
consequences of 4 having dreams. All this can be a slippery business,
and the “psychic powers” generally don’t turn out to be quite
what they seem. As one of my friends once said, “Yeah, I can fly,
but just not in this realm!” Buyer beware, or proceed with care.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
it does seem to be possible through powerful intent, strong
concentration ability, appreciation of interdependence and careful
experimentation to manipulate what we might call “this world”, as
well as those in it, in very unusual and profound ways. Yes, I am
referring to such things as telekinesis, mind control, reading other
peoples thoughts, pyromancy, and all of that. The more you get your
concentration and insight trips together and the more you look into
the magical aspect of things, the more you will learn about what I
will call the magical laws of the universe and how to use your will
to manipulate it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, if you
don’t have your morality trip really together, and perhaps even if
you do, I would be quite cautious about formally and consciously
tapping into that sort of power. It is absolutely vital to remember
that you will reap what you sow and that like leads to like when
considering the formal use of such power. Kind intention is
absolutely essential, but even this is often not enough to keep us
from screwing up when we give into the temptation to formally
manipulate the world in unusual ways. Power corrupts, as the old
adage goes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Spiritual traditions
across the board have a clear love/hate relationship to the powers,
and if you begin playing around with them you will come to understand
why. The stories of the Buddha demonstrate clearly that he and those
around him simultaneously found them extremely fascinating,
occasionally useful, and often profound. They also found them
dangerous, a sidetrack and abhorrent. Just as with any powerful
energy, such as sexual energy, the powers tend to reveal our true
colors, as it were.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When playing around
with the powers, I recommend careful attention to how we define
“real” and the practical implications of our personal definition
of “real” for our daily life. For instance, you might have just
come back from a retreat where you were playing around with
visualization abilities, and a few days later see a troop of radiant
angels floating through the walls and into your living room where you
are entertaining guests. This was your actual experience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Whether you choose
to ignore them, give them lots of attention, mention them to your
guests, get down on your knees and begin praying, or run screaming
out the door will have different implications for your actual life.
These implications should be carefully considered when conducting
yourself in the face of such experiences. On a side note, if you have
learned to see angels, you will probably run into devils soon enough.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As to the more
manipulative powers, you might begin to get the sense that you can
read the thoughts and emotions of others. Do you want to tell them
this, or even act on these intuitive feelings on the assumption that
they are correct? You might get the sense that you can manipulate the
emotions or energetic states of others in ways that would be
considered magical. Is this a good idea? There are no easy answers to
some of the ethical and practical questions that can arise from the
powers, but I would advise a high level of caution and restraint.
Respect other’s rights and remember that actions done for other
than compassionate reasons are likely to cause an ugly backlash.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The experiences of
the “psychic powers” can be infinitely fascinating, as anything
you can imagine experiencing is possible. The powers can also lead to
people getting really, really weird. If you want to get to know about
your shadow side, this is one way to have a crash course. For
instance, it might be very educational to have your relationship
issues with your parents manifest as two large, slobbering demons who
hurl flaming stuffed animals at you while you are traveling out of
your body to the Grand Canyon, but it can often take lots of time and
reflection to figure out how these sorts of experiences make a
practical difference in our lives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As one Burmese man
once said to a friend of mine, “My brother does concentration
practice. You know, sometimes they go a little mad!” He was talking
about what can sometimes happen when people get into “psychic
powers.” Remember, most of these experiences are sufficient grounds
for a diagnosis of mental illness in the conventional medical world,
particularly if they begin to interfere with love and work, so seek
the guidance of those who simultaneously appear to be quite sane and
functional who also know how to navigate skillfully in this
territory. Finding these sorts of people is difficult but well worth
the effort.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, playing around
with visions and other extrasensory experiences, such as traveling
out of body, bilocation, etc., can sometimes cause one to feel
ungrounded, disconnected, otherworldly and scattered for hours or
even days afterwards, something I call a “ siddhi hangover.”
Exercise and focusing on anything physical can help, as can heavy
foods, orgasms and simply not practicing for a while.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Very strong insight
practices with a focus on impermanence can also help to break up
these experiences but are not particularly grounding in and of
themselves and may often be otherwise. Strongly stated resolutions to
not experience or use the powers can also be very helpful, such as
simply saying out loud, “I formally resolve that I will not
experience or use these powers (name them here) until I formally
resolve otherwise.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I would suggest care
and caution in dealing with all the visions and other supernormal or
paranormal experiences which might arise in practice. The primary
danger is taking them too seriously and thus assuming that they are
more important than they really are. It may be a good idea to leave
them until very late in one’s practice unless one has someone
around to guide them through their skillful use or unless one is
fairly balanced and has a good sense of humor about them. If not,
they can very easily become further tools of our defilements, long
psychedelic and manipulative tunnels to nowhere or destruction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I remember a letter
I received from a friend who was supposed to be on an intensive
insight meditation retreat but had slipped into playing with these
sorts of experiences. He was now fascinated by his ability to see
spirit animals and other supernormal beings and was having regular
conversations with some sort of low-level god that kept telling him
that he was making excellent progress in his insight practice, i.e.
exactly what he wanted to hear. However, the fact that he was having
stable visionary experiences and was buying into their content made
it abundantly clear that he wasn’t doing insight practices at all,
but was lost in and being fooled by these siddhis. You get the
picture. Now, don’t get me wrong. If one is looking for another way
to address one’s content and stuff, visions of things like spirit
animals can be very helpful. The trick is not to mix up content and
fundamental insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Psychic powers”
can be used skillfully as well, and there are whole traditions that
use them as their primary path. They can significantly broaden one’s
horizons and are so interesting that great depths of profoundly
steady concentration can easily be developed. They can increase the
intensity of our “mental” processes to such a high level that
they become very easy to see as they are, should we choose to do so.
They can also begin to blur the line between the “mental” and the
“physical” in ways that can be both disorienting and profound.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When we start
playing around with intentions, extended sensate realities and
energetic phenomena, it can seem as if there are two worlds or fields
of experience that interpenetrate each other, the ordinary one (“the
real world”) and the magical one (“second attention,” “astral
plane,” “spirit world,” etc.). Integrating these two
perspectives into one causal field without artificial dualities or
boundaries is quite a project, one with the potential to lead to very
high levels of realization or to madness. It is the high-stakes way
to play the game, but unfortunately seems to be largely unavoidable
past a certain point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The experiences of
the powers can help people live in the world in a way that is at once
appreciative of its richness and yet not overly serious about it or
fixated on it. At their best, they can serve as a basis for a very
deep exploration of sides of ourselves that we rarely see with such
clarity, particularly the territory detailed by the likes of Jung and
the Shamanic traditions. Occasionally, such experiences can bring
profound epiphanies, times when we see our issues and shadow sides so
clearly that our lives are definitely transformed for the better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While this next
point might sound a bit radical, there are good reasons to assume
that we are all acting at what might be considered a magical level
all the time and just doing it with little awareness of that fact.
The best argument I know of for learning how to work at the level of
the powers is to bring consciousness and compassion to a process that
is happening already. Said another way, as we are already casting
spells all the time, actually any time there is awareness and intent,
we might as well learn to do it well. On the other hand, playing
around with siddhis can bring up really screwed up stuff from our
subconscious that we are just not ready or able handle skillfully,
causing “siddhi bleedthrough” into our lives that is simply
unhelpful and very hard to integrate. Actually, when playing around
with any meditative technology, there is no free lunch. You always
end up being forced to face some further challenge having to do with
personal or spiritual growth, either then or shortly thereafter.
There doesn’t seem to be any getting around this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you want to
cultivate the siddhis, one must generally attain very “hard”
jhanaic states with the specifically intention to attain these
experiences, though they can and often do arise spontaneously as
well. <u>The</u> <u>Visuddhimagga</u> and <u>The</u> <u>Vimuttimagga</u>
(less encyclopedic and harder to find but much more readable) both
spell out how to attain “psychic powers” in great depth and
detail. You could also check out Bhante Gunaratana’s excellent
work, <u>The</u> <u>Path</u> <u>of</u> <u>Serenity</u> <u>and</u>
<u>Insight</u>. Simply follow the directions and explore, as they are
as accurate it gets. One should also see Sutta #2, The Fruits of the
Homeless Life, in <u>The</u>&nbsp; <u>Long</u> <u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Buddha</u>, for more information on all of the
concentration states and psychic powers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While magical or
mythical thinking is generally very unhelpful on the spiritual path,
it must be admitted that it is the only kind of thinking that can
make much sense of these sorts of experiences. However, know when to
turn it on and when to shut it off. If you are doing Jungian
psychotherapy, shamanic pathworking, working up the Tree of Life or
through the Tarot, or similar work, think as magically and mythically
as you wish. It might actually be very helpful. If you are trying to
do most other things, don’t!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While Theravada
Buddhism clearly states how to obtain the “psychic powers,” it
does not say much about how to use them, the benefits of them, or
their dangers. Tantra and many other traditions (such as some of the
shamanic traditions) do a much better job of dealing with these. One
might also check out the later writings of Carlos Castanada when he
was not so fascinated with hallucinogens (such as <u>The</u> <u>Art</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Dreaming</u>), go to an ashram that focuses on these
aspects of spiritual training, or check out traditions such as
Ceremonial Magick, Wicca, Thelema, the Golden Dawn, and the A.’.A.’..
Note, I will use the word magick with a “k” at times due to being
influenced by this and related traditions, as they advocate making a
distinction between show magic (illusions based on mechanisms and
slight of hand) and the territory of the powers or real magick.
Donald Michael Kraig’s <u>Modern</u> <u>Magick</u> is a classic on
the subject, as are the works of Aleister Crowley. Opinions on
Crowley vary widely, but buried in his frustrating works is gold that
is hard to find elsewhere. Despite all his quirks and failings, I
have a deep appreciation for many synchretic aspects of his work and
the depths of his dedication to making meditation and magick
accessible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is also possible
to use the experiences of the psychic powers, particularly the
visions and traveling out of body, as a basis for insight practice by
the standard method of bare sensate investigation with a focus on the
Three Characteristics of those sensations, as they arise out of
extremely high levels of clarity and concentration. These experiences
can also be so otherworldly in content that our normal fixations and
preoccupations may be left behind. Experiences of insight in these
realms can be staggering and awesome. They are not soon forgotten.
Tantric visualization practices at their best make powerful use of
this fact. By definition, if you have visualized a 3D intelligent
entity that is doing its own thing, you are in strong concentration
in the fourth jhana and it is just a question of seeing the Three
Characteristics of that to get some serious insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Psychic powers”
can also arise spontaneously from insight practice, particularly at
stage 4. The Arising and Passing Away and sometimes at stage 11.
Equanimity (see The Progress of Insight later). While the fourth
jhana is traditionally said to be the basis for the psychic powers,
simply getting so strongly into the first jhana that you can no
longer perceive a body coupled with the previous intention to have
these experiences can sometimes be a sufficient to make them occur.
Get really into the jhana, leave it, resolve to have these
experiences, and see what happens. Repeat as necessary. If that
doesn’t work, learn to visualize the colors white, blue, red and
yellow clearly as stable experiences and then repeat the above
instruction. If that doesn’t work, find the rare teacher who will
actually guide you into this esoteric territory. Better, find a good
teacher before getting into this territory! If all of that is not
enough, here is my best advice for working with the powers formally.
Once you have enough concentration to get into hard fourth jhana with
a range of objects and colors, here’s traditional Buddhist Magick
101 with some practical points thrown in:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. Make the bases
clean, meaning bathe quietly and put on clean clothes. This
instruction helps but is not necessary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. Find a suitable
place to work, meaning a place that is quiet and free of
distractions. If you can’t find such a place or you feel compelled
to do magick in less than optimal circumstances (such as in public on
the fly), obviously skip this step.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. Think the whole
thing through before you proceed. Never, ever skip this step if you
can possibly help it. This step not only helps to keep you from
seriously screwing up, it is actually part of the spell and a very
important part of the set-up. Essential things to include are:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">a) what you are
asking for,<br/>
 b) how to phrase it or intend it, being as specific
as you possibly can,<br/>
 c) why you are asking for that,
particularly if there is some more fundamental desire you hope to
fulfill that you should focus on while letting the less important
specifics happen as they may,<br/>
 d) exactly who or what is
involved,<br/>
 e) and every single possible good and bad
ramification of what you are about to do that you can possibly think
of. Really take your time with this one, visualizing the whole thing
out in time and space as far as it could possibly go.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Note: if the ethics
of what you are going to do feel at all strange in any part of your
being, particularly your heart or gut, you probably need to go back
up to the top and rethink the whole thing while looking at the
problem from other points of view.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">4. Rise from the
first to the fourth jhana. Build each one up carefully and fully
along the way so that you have a good foundation from which to work.
Those who can access the formless realms (discussed shortly) might
rise all the way through them as well. Then leave the fourth (or
eighth) jhana and formally intend to make whatever you want to occur
happen, which is to say let the full energy of your intention fly
without hesitation or restraint. If you are going to do this, make
sure you commit to it, which is why the third step is so important.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">5. Let it go and see
what happens.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One last warning on
the powers: doing these things in the private is one thing, doing
magickal things in public that involve other people is something else
entirely. If you do overt public magick or discrete public magick,
you are bound to run into someone else’s paradigms, values, and
sets of beliefs about how the world is and what is possible that are
not in alignment with your own. The potential for bad reactions from
others is very real for a large number of reasons. Consider the long,
strange relationship between the Western mainstream point of view and
everything from witchcraft to crime solving psychics. In short, if
you do formal magick and anyone else finds out about it or thinks
they were affected by it, be ready for the possibility of serious
backlash and fallout.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The formless realms
are the last option one can follow from the fourth jhana, and they
can definitely be very useful for putting things into perspective and
sorting out a few details about “awareness” (as will be mentioned
below). Before I go into the formless realms, I will digress for just
a moment to a brief and belated discussion of...</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5544_1179888903"></a><a name="22__NO_SELF_VS__TRUE_SELF"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_54"></a>
22. NO-SELF VS. TRUE SELF</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is one of those
questions that tends to arise when Hinduism or Christianity come in
contact with Buddhism. However, perhaps it should arise more when
Buddhism is thinking about itself. I include this discussion here
because it addresses some points that are useful for later and
previous discussions. True Self and no-self are actually talking
about the same thing, just from different perspectives. Each can be
useful, but each is an extreme. Truly, the truth is a Middle Way
between these and is indescribable, but I will try to explain it
anyway in the hope that it may support actual practice. It may seem
odd to put a chapter that deals with the fruits of insight practices
in the middle of descriptions of the samatha jhanas, but hopefully
when you read the next chapter you will understand why it falls where
it does.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For all you
intellectuals out there, the way in which this chapter is most likely
to support practice is to be completely incomprehensible and thus
useless. Ironically, I have tried to make this chapter very clear,
and in doing so have crafted a mess of paradoxes. In one of his
plays, Shakespeare puts philosophers on par with lawyers. In terms of
insight practice, a lawyer who is terrible at insight practices but
tries to do them anyway is vastly superior to a world-class
philosopher who is merely an intellectual master of this theory but
practices not at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember that the
spiritual life is something you do and hopefully understand but not
some doctrine to believe. Those of you who are interested in the
formal Buddhist dogmatic anti-dogma should check out the particularly
profound suttas, #1, The Root of All Things, in <u>The</u>&nbsp;
<u>Middle</u> <u>Length</u> <u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Buddha</u>, as well as sutta #1, The Supreme Net (What the
Teaching is Not), in <u>The</u> <u>Long</u> <u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u>&nbsp;
<u>the</u> <u>Buddha</u>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, realize that
all of this language is basically useless in the end and prone to not
making much sense. Only examination of our reality will help us to
actually directly understand this, but it will not be in a way
accessible to the rational mind. Nothing in the content of our
thoughts can really explain the experience of the understanding I am
about to point to, though there is something in the direct experience
of those thoughts that might reveal it. Everything that I am about to
try to explain here can become a great entangling net of useless
views without direct insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Many of the juvenile
and tedious disputes between the various insight traditions result
from fixation on these concepts and inappropriate adherence to only
one side of these apparent paradoxes. Not surprisingly, these
disputes between insight traditions generally arise from those with
little or no insight. One clear mark of the development of true
insight is that these paradoxes lose their power to confuse and
obscure. They become tools for balanced inquiry and instruction,
beautiful poetry, intimations of the heart of the spiritual life and
of one’s own direct and non-conceptual experience of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No-self teachings
directly counter the sense that there is a separate watcher, and that
this watcher is an “I” that is in control, observing reality or
subject to the tribulations of the world. Truly, this is a useful
illusion to counter. However, if misunderstood, this teaching can
produce a shadow side that reeks of nihilism, disengagement with life
and denial. People can get all fixated on eliminating a “self,”
when the emphasis is supposed to be on the words “separate” and
“permanent,” as well as on the illusion that is being creating. A
better way to say this would be, “stopping the process of mentally
creating the illusion of a separate self from sensations that are
inherently non-dual, utterly transient and thus empty of any
separate, permanent self.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Even if you get
extremely enlightened, you will still be here from a conventional
point of view, but you will also be just an interdependent and
intimate part of this utterly transient universe, just as you
actually always have been. The huge and yet subtle difference is that
this will be known directly and clearly. The language “eliminating
your ego” is similarly misunderstood most of the time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You see, there are
physical phenomena and mental phenomena, as well as the
“consciousness” or mental echo of these, which is also in the
category of mental phenomena. These are just phenomena, and all
phenomena are not a permanent, separate self, as they all change and
are all intimately interdependent. They are simply “aware,” i.e.
manifest, where they are without any observer of them at all. The
boundaries that seem to differentiate self from not-self are
arbitrary and conceptual, i.e. not the true nature of things. Said
another way, reality is intimately interdependent and non-dual, like
a great ocean.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is also
“awareness”, but awareness is not a thing or localized in a
particular place, so to even say “there is also awareness” is
already a tremendous problem, as it implies separateness and
existence where none can be found. To be really philosophically
correct about it, borrowing heavily from Nagarjuna, awareness cannot
be said to fit any of the following descriptions: that it exists,
that it does not exist, that it both exists and does not exist, that
it neither exists nor doesn’t exist. Just so, in truth, it cannot
be said that: we are awareness, that we are not awareness, that we
are both awareness and not awareness, or even that we are neither
awareness nor not awareness. We could go through the same pattern
with whether or not phenomena are intrinsically luminous.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For the sake of
discussion, and in keeping with standard Buddhist thought, awareness
is permanent and unchanging. It is also said that, “All things
arise from it, and all things return to it,” though again this
implies a false certainty about something which is actually
impenetrably mysterious and mixing the concept of infinite potential
with awareness is a notoriously dangerous business. We could call it
“God,” “Nirvana,” “The Tao,” “The Void,” “Allah,”
“Krishna,” “Intrinsic Luminosity,” “Buddha Nature,”
“Buddha,” “Bubba” or just “awareness” as long as we
realize the above caveats, especially that it is not a thing or
localized in any particular place and has no definable qualities.
Awareness is sometimes conceptualized as pervading all of this while
not being all of this, and sometimes conceptualized as being inherent
in all of this while not being anything in particular. Neither is
quite true, though both perspectives can be useful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you find yourself
adopting any fixed idea about what we are calling “awareness”
here, try also adopting its logical opposite to try to achieve some
sense of direct inquisitive paradoxical imbalance that shakes fixed
views about this stuff and points to something beyond these limited
concepts. This is incredibly useful advice for dealing with all
teachings about “Ultimate Reality.” I would also recommend
looking into the true nature of the sensations that make up
philosophical speculation and all sensations of questioning. While
phenomena are in flux from their arising to their passing, there is
awareness of them. Thus, awareness is not these objects, as it is not
a thing, nor is it separate from these objects, as there would be no
experience if this were so. By examining our reality just as it is,
we may come to understand this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, phenomena
do not exist in the sense of abiding in a fixed way for any length of
time, and thus are utterly transitory, and yet the laws that govern
the functioning of this utter transience hold. That phenomena do not
exist does not mean that there is not a reality, but that this
reality is completely inconstant, except for awareness, which is not
a thing. This makes no sense to the rational mind, but that is how it
is with this stuff.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One teaching that
comes out of the Theravada that can be helpful is that there are
Three Ultimate Dharmas or ultimate aspects of reality: <b>materiality</b>
(the sensations of the first five sense doors), <b>mentality</b> (all
mental sensations) and <b>Nirvana</b> (though they would call it
“Nibbana,” which is the Pali equivalent of the Sanskrit). In
short, this is actually it, and “that” which is beyond this is
also it. Notice that “awareness” is definitely not on this list.
It might be conceptualized as being all three (from a True Self point
of view), or quickly discarded as being a useless concept that
solidifies a sense of a separate or localized “watcher” (from the
no-self point of view).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Buddhism also
contains a strangely large number of True Self teachings, though if
you told most Buddhists this they would give you a good scolding.
Many of these have their origins in Hindu Vedanta and Hindu Tantra.
All the talk of Buddha Nature, the Bodhisattva Vow, and that sort of
thing are True Self teachings. True Self teachings point out that
this “awareness” is “who we are,” but it isn’t a thing, so
it is not self. They also point out that we actually are all these
phenomena, rather than all of these phenomena being seen as something
observed and thus not self, which they are also as they are utterly
transient and not awareness. This teaching can help students actually
examine their reality just as it is and sort of “inhabit it” in a
honest and realistic way, or it can cause them to cling to things as
“self” if they misunderstand this teaching. I will try again...
You see, as all phenomena are observed, they cannot possibly be the
observer. Thus, the observer, which is awareness and not any of the
phenomena pretending to be it, cannot possibly be a phenomenon and
thus is not localized and doesn’t exist. This is no-self. However,
all of these phenomena are actually us from the point of view of
non-duality and interconnectedness, as the illusion of duality is
just an illusion. When the illusion of duality permanently collapses
in final awakening, all that is left is all of these phenomena, which
is True Self, i.e. the lack of a separate self and thus just all of
this as it is. Remember, however, that no phenomena abide for even an
instant, and so are empty of permanent abiding and thus of stable
existence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This all brings me
to one of my favorite words, “non-dual,” a word that means that
both duality and unity fail to clearly describe ultimate reality. As
“awareness” is in some way separate from and unaffected by
phenomena, we can’t say that that unity is the true answer. <i>Unitive</i>
<i>experiences</i> <i>arise</i> <i>out</i> <i>of</i> <i>strong</i>
<i>concentration</i> <i>and</i> <i>can</i> <i>easily</i> <i>fool</i>
<i>people</i> <i>into</i> <i>thinking</i> <i>they</i> <i>are</i> <i>the</i>
<i>final</i> <i>answer</i>. <i>They</i> <i>are</i> <i>not</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That said, it is
because “awareness” is not a phenomena, thing or localized in any
place that you can’t say that duality is true. A duality implies
something on both sides, an observer and an observed. However, there
is no phenomenal observer, so duality does not hold up under careful
investigation. Until we have a lot of fundamental insight, the sense
that duality is true can be very compelling and can cause all sorts
of trouble. We extrapolate false dualities from sensations until we
are very highly enlightened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, the word
“non-dual” is an inherently paradoxical term, one that confounds
reason and even our current experience of reality. If we accept the
working hypothesis that non-duality is true, then we will be able to
continue to reject both unitive and dualistic experiences as the true
answer and continue to work towards awakening. This is probably the
most practical application of discussions of no-self and True Self.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No-self and True
Self are really just two sides of the same coin. There is a great
little poem by one Kalu Rinpoche that goes something like:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>We
live in illusion<br/>
 And the appearance of things. <br/>
 There is
a reality:<br/>
 We are that reality.<br/>
 When you understand
this,<br/>
 You will see that you are nothing.<br/>
 And, being
nothing,<br/>
 You are everything.<br/>
 That is all.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are many fine
poems on similar themes presented in Sogyal Rinpoche’s <u>The</u>
<u>Tibetan</u> <u>Book</u> <u>of</u> <u>Living</u> <u>and</u> <u>Dying</u>.
It is because we are none of this that freedom is possible. It is
because we are all of this that compassionate action for all beings
and ourselves is so important. To truly understand this moment is to
truly understand both, which is the Middle Way between these two
extremes (see Nisargadatta’s <u>I</u> <u>Am</u> <u>That</u>&nbsp;
for a very down-to-earth discussion of these issues). While only
insight practices will accomplish this, there are some concentration
attainments (the last four jhanas or Formless Realms) that can really
help put things in proper perspective, though they do not directly
cause deep insights and awakening unless the true nature of the
sensations that make them up is understood.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5546_1179888903"></a><a name="23__THE_FORMLESS_REALMS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_55"></a>
23. THE FORMLESS REALMS</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The formless realms
never fail to impress and amaze. They can also be taken to be much
more significant than they really are. The trick is to come to a
balanced understanding of what they are and what they aren’t, what
they are useful for and what they do not accomplish. This is not
always easy.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5548_1179888903"></a><a name="BOUNDLESS_SPACE__THE_FIFTH_JHANA"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_56"></a>
BOUNDLESS SPACE, THE FIFTH JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To attain this
state, one simply continues to cultivate the fourth jhana and begins
to not pay attention to the objects in the meditation space but
gently to space itself. How big is reality? Tuning into the panoramic
quality of attention itself when in the fourth jhana can be very
helpful. This is quite a fine line, but it can definitely be done.
Forms then slip away like ghosts into thin air, and the mind turns to
boundless space, the fifth jhana, as the object of concentration.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This jhana is often
called “Infinite Space”, as the next one is often called
“Infinite Consciousness”, but I prefer the word “boundless”
because it is much closer to the actual experience of these stages.
People imagine that they might simultaneously perceive the whole of
space, but what actually happens is that the perceptual boundaries
drop away and a very unitive openness prevails. This open quality
itself becomes the primary focus rather than what is unified in that
openness. This aspect was already present in the 4th Jhana, but now
it comes to the fore. The same is true of the next formless realm.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is not
necessarily as perfectly clean as it sounds, depending on how solidly
one in this state, but it still quite spectacular. When this state is
really cultivated, all or most images and sense of a body are gone,
and almost all that is left is vastness. There is still thought and
the illusion of a separate self, i.e. duality, but the mind is
extremely quiet and the duality subtle. The equanimity from the 4th
Jhana remains, as the formless realms use this state as their
foundation. Sounds might still be noticeable depending on the depth
of the state. Note, if one attains this state while meditating with
the eyes open it may have a very different quality to it than if the
eyes are closed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">From this state, the
meditator has a few options. They can get stuck, which may be more
prone to happening if they are incorrectly practicing non-dual
formless practices such as dzogchen by fixating too much on the
phrase “space-like awareness.” They can also either go on to the
next formless realm (boundless consciousness) or investigate this
state and thus begin the progress of insight. If this last option is
chosen, special care and extreme precision must be given to each and
every instant that the many sensations that make up the perception of
space, silence or equanimity are perceived so as to see each of these
experiences arise and pass completely in each instant, not satisfy,
and not be self.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It may seem odd to
think of the sensations of space arising and passing away each
instant, but space is a conditioned aspect of relative reality, and
is thus impermanent like all other aspects of experiential reality.
This can be an important attainment, as it clarifies that awareness,
that non-thing that is often described as space-like, is actually not
even space, though it is not separate from space, as in the chapter
called No-self vs. True Self.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are few things
quite as odd, profound, and possibly disconcerting as investigating
the first three formless realms and perceiving them strobe in and out
of existence, but this is powerful practice and a very valuable and
high attainment. Again, this state may be left and insight practices
begun with the benefits of the residue of this state calming, opening
and stabilizing the mind for a short time after it ends.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5550_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_57"></a><a name="BOUNDLESS_CONSCIOUSNESS__THE_SIX"></a>
BOUNDLESS CONSCIOUSNESS, THE SIXTH JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If the meditator
wishes to go further into the formless realms, then they should
continue to cultivate attention to boundless space and begin to
notice that they are conscious of all of it, and thus space is filled
with consciousness. As some point the mind will abandon boundless
space and shift to perceiving boundless consciousness, the sixth
jhana. This can feel outrageously unitive, as consciousness seems to
fill the whole universe. Space becomes “luminous,” and this can
be confused with descriptions of the fundamental luminosity of
awareness and with non-duality, though this is definitely not the
attainment of the understanding of those. Again, equanimity prevails.
This state has a sense of presence to it that boundless space
doesn't. It is also a great staging ground for exploration of the
“psychic powers.” 0 From here the meditator has various options.
They can get stuck, which can happen fairly easily if they are
mistaking dzogchen or other non-dual formless practices for
meditation on the concentration object of boundless consciousness,
again due to misunderstanding or overemphasizing the phrase
“space-like awareness.” They can also go on to cultivate the next
formless realm (nothingness), or they can investigate boundless
consciousness and then begin the progress of insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For this last
option, extremely careful attention must be given to each moment that
the sensations that make up the perceptions of consciousness,
vastness, or equanimity arise and pass away. Great precision must be
given to the fact that these sensations do not satisfy and cannot be
self or imply a separate self. Because of how fundamentally
disconcerting (unsatisfactory) it can be to have the three illusions
shattered at this level of clarity and simplicity, this is not an
easy practice but can be very powerful. It is actually much more
likely that such insights into the true nature of the three first
formless realms will arise spontaneously due to previous skillful
insight practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, experiencing
boundless consciousness strobing in and out of reality can be
profoundly helpful in convincing us that even boundless consciousness
that fills the vastness of space is not awareness, though awareness
cannot be said to be separate from consciousness. What is observing
boundless consciousness strobe in and out of reality? Now, there is a
question, perhaps The Question.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5552_1179888903"></a><a name="NOTHINGNESS__THE_SEVENTH_JHANA"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_58"></a>
NOTHINGNESS, THE SEVENTH JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If the meditator
wishes to attain to the next formless realm, that of nothingness,
they simply cultivate the jhana of boundless consciousness and
disenchant themselves with the vastness and luminosity of that state.
Eventually, the mind will abandon these and shift to the jhana of
nothingness. To imagine this state, imagine space with all of the
lights completely out, so that there is no vastness, and almost no
sensations other than those of nothingness. It is almost as though
attention is out of phase with nearly all phenomena except those that
imply nothingness. They are still there somewhere, but they are not
being attended to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This jhana is
different from the previous two formless realms in that they are
quite present to reality in some way and panoramic in 1 perspective,
whereas nothingness is more turned away from phenomena and perhaps
more focused in some way. There is, however, some very subtle thought
and some extremely subtle sense of a separate self. Note well,
nothingness is absolutely not emptiness, though it is empty, but this
is not the attainment of this understanding. However, one can easily
be convinced that this is emptiness due to the extreme profundity of
it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As before, this
jhana can have different degrees of intensity to it. Even when one is
not strongly in it, there is a sense of being out of phase with
reality, like being dissociated. Reality is there, but you have tuned
it out on your radio. Note well, this is very different from just
being “tuned out” in the colloquial sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While equanimity
prevails, this state can be a bit scary at first, and this can cause
some instability of this state. Now even consciousness and space are
basically gone. However, there is still awareness of this state,
indicating that there can be awareness that is not particularly
consciousness or space. This really helps debunk the sense that
awareness is consciousness or space or even a thing, that we are our
body, etc. That said, it is not nothingness either. Nothingness may
be perceived, whereas awareness may not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">From this state, the
mind may get stuck, but this is not quite as likely as with the first
two formless states, as this state is quite refined but not as
breathtaking as the first two in some ways. The meditator may then
try to move on to the next jhana, or may investigate this state. It
may seem incredible that the sensations of nothingness itself could
be observed to arise and pass, i.e. strobe in and out of reality, or
that they could be known to not satisfy or not be self. However, this
is definitely possible, if potentially quite disconcerting due to its
extreme profundity and ability to really kick some sense into the
mind about the truth of things. It also helps debunk the false idea
that “The Void” or “awareness” is nothingness. It is not even
this. Remember, no sensation can observe another, so anything you can
think of cannot be said to be “awareness.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">By simply paying
close attention to every instant that nothingness or equanimity is
perceived, and with precise attention to the exact arising and
passing of each of these, that these transient moments do not
satisfy, and that these neither can impute nor can be a separate
self, the three illusions can begin to be penetrated in the highest
state in which this can be accomplished. As this is a particularly
subtle business, the meditator may also leave the jhana and begin
insight practice in the afterglow of this state as before. Strobing
sensations of nothingness are more likely to arise during the
progress of insight in the stage called High Equanimity for those
with very strong concentration skills.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5554_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_59"></a><a name="NEITHER_PERCEPTION_NOR_YET_NON_P"></a>
NEITHER PERCEPTION NOR YET NON-PERCEPTION,<br/>
 THE EIGHTH JHANA</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If the meditator
wishes to attain the next jhana, they simply hang out in nothingness
until they get bored with perception entirely and understand that
even perception is somehow disconcerting. Thus, the mind will
eventually shift on its own to the state with the perplexing but
thoroughly appropriate title of “neither perception nor yet
non-perception,” hereafter “the eighth jhana” for the sake of
brevity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This state is
largely incomprehensible, but it is absolutely not emptiness. It is
empty, but this is not the attainment of that understanding. The
eighth jhana may very easily be confused as being emptiness,
especially if it is attained through insight practices (remember that
insight practices can simultaneously cultivate concentration and
wisdom). There is no reasonable way to attempt to describe this
state, save for that it is a mind state, and thus is not emptiness,
as emptiness is not a mind state or anything else for that matter. I
am tempted to say that one is simultaneously focused so narrowly that
one notices nothing and yet so broadly that one doesn’t notice even
that, but such a description doesn’t quite do this state justice.
One way or the other, there is complete inattention to diversity. The
eighth jhana is the highest of the states of concentration that can
be attained, ignoring the attainment of the cessation of perception
and feeling, see the Appendix.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is not possible
to investigate this state, as it is too incomprehensible, or to move
to a higher state. Thus, as this state ends, the meditator may return
to lower states or turn to insight practice in the afterglow of this
state. It should also be noted that, in contrast to the previous
seven jhanas, the issue of “hard” or “soft” jhana that
relates to how solidly one is in a state does not apply to the eighth
jhana. You are either in it or you are not. The eighth jhana may have
a certain stability that nothingness doesn’t due to the inability
to make sense of it or go beyond it. Thus, the mind may move fairly
quickly from boundless consciousness, through nothingness, and drop
into the eighth jhana for a while, though the vaguest hint of
attention to anything specific demolishes this state instantly. It is
also possible to sort of drift up and down through the various
formless realms, and shifting back down to lower jhanas after being
up in higher jhanas such as this one can lend a great deal of
intensity to them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The eighth jhana can
be sorted out from the attainment of emptiness by a number of signs
having to do with the way the entrance to the state presents itself
(i.e. not being one of the Three Doors and thus not relating to the
rapid and clear presentation of one of the Three Characteristics
three or four times in quick succession), what came before this (i.e.
not the stages of insight, see below) and the fact that there is
still some subtle sense of a state and thus relative reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just to drive this
point home, an important feature of concentration practices is that
they are not liberating in and of themselves. Even the highest of
these states ends. The afterglow from them does not last that long,
and regular reality might even seem like a bit of an assault when it
is gone. However, jhana-junkies still abound, and many have no idea
that this is what they have become. I have a good friend who has been
lost in the formless realms for over 20 years, attaining them again
and again in his practice, rationalizing that he is doing dzogchen
practice (a type of insight practice) when he is just sitting in the
4th-6th jhanas, rationalizing that the last two formless realms are
emptiness, and rationalizing that he is enlightened. It is a true
dharma tragedy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Unfortunately, as
another good friend of mine rightly pointed out, it is very hard to
reach such people after a while. They get tangled in golden chains so
beautiful that they have no idea they are even in prison, nor do they
tend to take kindly to suggestions that this may be so, particularly
if their identity has become bound up in their false notion that they
are a realized being. Chronic jhana-junkies are fairly easy to
identify, even though they often imagine that they are not. I have no
problem with people becoming jhana-junkies, as we are all presumably
able to take responsibilities for our choices in life. However, when
people don’t realize that this is what they have become and pretend
that what they are doing has something to do with insight practices,
that’s annoying and sad.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To try to clearly
differentiate between concentration practice and insight practice, I
will now give a detailed description of the stages of insight so that
the contrast will be as clear as possible. Pay careful attention to
how different these descriptions are from those of the pure
concentration states.</p>

24. THE PROGRESS OF INSIGHT</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The progress of
insight is a set of stages that diligent meditators pass through on
the path of insight. Some of the “content based” or psychological
insights into ourselves can be interesting and helpful, but when I
say “insight,” these stages are what I am talking about. Just so
that you have seen the whole list of the names of these stages, the
formal names of stages of insight in order are:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will give detailed
descriptions of them shortly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will refer to
these stages by their shortened titles, their numbers and
occasionally short-hand slang. These are formally known as “Knowledge
of” and then the stage, e.g. “Knowledge of Mind and Body,” but
I will just use the part after the “of.” They are also called
“ñanas,” which means “knowledges”, usually with a number, as
in “the First Ñana.” Notice that I use the word stage rather
than state. These are stages of heightened perception into the truth
of things, opportunities to see directly how things actually are, but
they are not seemingly stable states as with concentration practice.
The jhanaic groupings refer to vipassana jhanas, which will be
covered in more depth later, but they borrow their perspectives and
certain fundamental aspects from their samatha jhana equivalents. In
other ways they may diverge widely from the experience of pure
samatha jhanas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>One</i> <i>of</i>
<i>the</i> <i>most</i> <i>profound</i> <i>things</i> <i>about</i>
<i>these</i> <i>stages</i> <i>is</i> <i>that</i> <i>they</i> <i>are</i>
<i>strangely</i> <i>predictable</i> <i>regardless</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i>
<i>practitioner</i> <i>or</i> <i>the</i> <i>insight</i> <i>tradition</i>.
Texts two thousand years old describe the stages just the way people
go through them today, though there will be some individual variation
on some of the particulars today as then. The Christian maps, the
Sufi maps, the Buddhist maps of the Tibetans and the Theravada, and
the maps of the Khabbalists and Hindus are all remarkably consistent
in their fundamentals. I chanced into these classic experiences
before I had any training in meditation, and I have met a large
number of people who have done likewise. These maps, Buddhist or
otherwise, are talking about something inherent in how our minds
progress in fundamental wisdom that has little to do with any
tradition and lots to do with the mysteries of the human mind and
body. These stages are not Buddhist but universal, and Buddhism is
merely one of the traditions that describes them, albeit unusually
well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The progress of
insight is discussed in a number of good books, such as Jack
Kornfield’s <u>A</u> <u>Path</u> <u>with</u> <u>Heart</u> in the
section called Dissolving the Self, which I highly recomment. A very
extensive, thorough, accessible and highly recommended treatment of
it is given in Mahasi Sayadaw’s works <u>The</u> <u>Progress</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Insight</u> and <u>Practical</u> <u>Insight</u>&nbsp; <u>Meditation</u>
(on BPS out of Sri Lanka), a partially castrated version of which
appears in Jack Kornfield’s <u>Living</u> <u>Dharma</u>. It should
be noted here that <u>Practical</u> <u>Insight</u> <u>Meditation</u>
is my favorite dharma book of all time with no close competitors. If
you can ever lay your hands on a copy, do so! Even the section of it
that appears in <u>Living</u> <u>Dharma</u> is much better than
having access to none of it at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sayadaw U Pandita’s
<u>In</u> <u>This</u> <u>Very</u> <u>Life</u> also covers this
territory, and is a bit of a must have for those who like lists and
straight-up Theravada, but he leaves out a lot of juicy details. <u>The</u>
<u>Visuddhimagga</u> , a 5th Century text by Buddhaghosa, also does a
nice treatment of these stages, and contains some interesting and
hard to find information. It focuses largely on the emotional
side-effects and thus misses many useful points. Another good but
brief map appears in Ven. Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche’s <u>Dharma</u>
<u>Paths</u>. You could also check out Bhante Gunaratana’s <u>The</u>
<u>Path</u> <u>of</u> <u>Serenity</u> <u>and</u> <u>Insight</u> if
you would like to know the dogma well. It is a thorough and scholarly
work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Matthew Flickstein’s
<u>Swallowing</u> <u>the</u> <u>River</u> <u>Ganges</u> is a light&nbsp;
reatment of basic Buddhist concepts and contains a very superficial
treatment of the stages of insight. It is kind of like what would
happen if you condensed a medical school textbook down to a 5th grade
science text. It focuses almost entirely on the emotional side
effects and thus misses a huge amount that is worthy of discussion,
but it comes from a good place and is harmless enough. It doesn’t
add anything to the above sources but is easy to read.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are many less
accessible maps of insight as well. <u>The</u> <u>Tibetan</u>&nbsp;
<u>Book</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Dead</u> , <u>Liberation</u>
<u>Through</u> <u>Hearing</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Bardo</u>
requires some prior familiarity with this territory to sort out the
wild symbolic imagery. A 12th Century Sufi map is given in <u>Journey</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Lord</u> <u>of</u>&nbsp; <u>Power</u> by Ibn
'Arabi, but again the medieval symbolism is somewhat hard to untangle
unless you are already personally familiar with these stages. It also
provides a very interesting if quite cryptic description of the
higher stages of realization. St. John of the Cross’ <u>The</u>
<u>Dark</u> <u>Night</u> <u>of</u>&nbsp; <u>The</u> <u>Soul</u> does
a good job of dealing with the most difficult of the insight stages.
His map is called The Ladder of Love. Unfortunately, the translation
of the medieval Spanish and thickness of complex Catholic dogma make
it a fairly inaccessible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>I</i> <i>strongly</i>
<i>recommend</i> <i>that</i> <i>you</i> <i>consult</i> <i>some</i> <i>of</i>
<i>these</i> <i>other</i> <i>sources</i>, particularly the first five
mentioned. While I consider the treatment of the stages of insight
that follows shortly to be by far the most comprehensive and
practical explanation of the stages of insight ever written, and I
mean that honestly, there are still lots of great points made in
those books, and you should check them out. There is a huge amount of
valuable information left out in all of these sources, perhaps due to
the Mushroom Factor, but perhaps due to some of the&nbsp; ifficulties
in describing all the little nuances of the subject in all its
possible variations. Thus, working with a teacher who has personal
mastery of these stages (regardless of what they call them) is an&nbsp;
xtremely good idea most of the time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The model
terminology I am using is from the ancient&nbsp; ommentaries on the
Pali Canon of the Theravada tradition. This model is used mostly in
Burma but is also used to some degree in the other Theravada
traditions. Zen is quite aware of these stages, as all Zen Masters
had to go through them and continue to do so, but they tend not to
name them or talk about them, as is their typical style. This can be
helpful, as people can get all obsessed with these maps, turning them
into a new form of useless content and a source of imprisoning
identification and competition. This is the ugly shadow side of
goal-oriented or map-based practice, but it often (though not always)
may be overcome with honest awareness of this fact.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Luckily, if the
meditator really is into insight territory, continued correct
practice has a way of unsticking them given time. Also, when the
proverbial stuff is hitting the fan, having a map around can really
help the meditator not make too many of the common and tempting
mistakes of that stage, as well as provide the meditator with faith
that that they are on the right track when they hit the hard or weird
stages. These stages can significantly color or skew a meditator’s
view of their life until they master them, and it can be very helpful
to remember this when trying to navigate this territory and keep
one’s job and relationships functioning. Those who do not have the
benefit of the maps in these situations or who choose to ignore them
are much more easily blindsided by the psychological extremes and
challenges which may sometimes accompany stages such as The Arising
and Passing Away and those of The Dark Night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While many people
don’t want to know the maps for various reasons (such as their own
unexamined insecurities), I suspect that many more people could get a
lot farther in their practice if they did know them. At their very
least, the maps clearly demonstrate that there is vastly more to all
this than just philosophy or psychology. <i>They</i> <i>also</i>
<i>clearly</i> <i>and</i> <i>unambiguously</i> <i>point</i> <i>to</i>
<i>how</i> <i>the</i> <i>game</i> <i>is</i> <i>played</i> <i>step</i>
<i>by</i> <i>step</i> <i>and</i> <i>stage</i> <i>by</i> <i>stage</i>,
<i>what</i> <i>one</i> <i>is</i> <i>looking</i> <i>for</i> <i>and</i>
<i>more</i> <i>importantly</i> <i>why</i>, <i>and</i> <i>give</i>
<i>guidelines</i> <i>for</i> <i>how</i> <i>to</i> <i>avoid</i>
<i>screwing</i> <i>up</i> <i>along</i> <i>the</i> <i>way</i>. Why
people wouldn’t want to know these things is completely beyond me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They fill in the
juicy details of the seemingly vast gap from doing some seemingly
boring and simple practice to getting enlightened. Further, providing
all of this extremely precise information on exactly what to do puts
the responsibility for progress or a lack thereof clearly on the
meditator (e.g. you), which is exactly where it should be. If after
reading this book you don’t put this extremely powerful information
into practice, the fault is your own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is
considerable evidence that the lack of this information in insight
traditions that don’t use the maps has been one of the primary
obstacles to progress. On the other hand, the maps can sometimes
cause furious competition and arrogance in the traditions that do use
them, as well as harmful fixation on purely future-oriented goals.
Please, do your very best to avoid these sorts of problems.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The more intense,
consistent and precise the practice, the easier it is to see how the
maps apply. The more energy, focus and consistency is put into
practice, the more dramatic and even outrageous these stages can be.
If these stages unfold over long periods of time and gently, it can
be more difficult to see the progression through them, though it does
happen regardless. Certain emphases in practice, such as Mahasi
Sayadaw style “noting” practice, particularly on intensive
retreats, seem to produce a clearer appreciation of the maps, and
some individuals will have an easier time seeing how these maps apply
than others will.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Each stage is marked
by very specific increases in our perceptual abilities. The basic
areas we can improve in are clarity, precision, speed, consistency,
inclusiveness and acceptance. It is these improvements in our
perceptual abilities that are the hallmarks of each stage and the
gold standard by which they are defined and known. Each stage also
tends to bring up mental and physical raptures (unusual
manifestations). These are fairly predictable at each stage and
sometimes very unique to each stage. They are secondary to the
increase in perceptual thresholds of ways by which we may judge
whether or not we are in a particular stage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Each stage also
tends to bring up specific aspects of our emotional and psychological
makeup. These are also strangely predictable, but these are not as
reliable for determining which stage is occurring. They are
suggestible, ordinary, and will show more variation from person to
person. However, when used in conjunction with the changes in
perceptual threshold and the raptures, they can help us get a clearer
sense of which stage has been attained. Further, these stages occur
in a very predictable order, and so looking for a pattern of stages
leading one to the next can help us get a sense of what is going on.
Thus, when reading my descriptions of these stages, pay attention to
these separate aspects: the shift in perceptual threshold, the
physical and mental raptures, the emotional and psychological
tendencies, and the overall pattern of how that stage fits with the
rest.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, the meditator
sits down (or lies down, stands, etc.) and begins to try to
experience each and every sensation clearly as it is. When the
meditator gains enough concentration to steady the mind on the object
of meditation, something called “access concentration,” they may
enter the first jhana, now called the “first vipassana jhana,”
which is in some ways the same for both concentration practice and
insight practice at the beginning. However, as they have been
practicing insight meditation, they are not trying to solidify this
state, but are trying to penetrate the three illusions by
understanding the Three Characteristics.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They have been
trying to sort out with mindfulness what is body and what is mind and
when each is and isn’t there. They have been trying to be clear
about the actual sensations that make up their world just as they
are. They have been trying to directly understand the Three
Characteristics moment to moment in whatever sensations arise, be it
in a restricted area of space, such as the area of the sensations of
breathing, a moving area of space (e.g. body-scanning practices), in
the whole of their world as is done in choiceless awareness
practices, using some other technique or object, or just by being
alive and paying attention. Thus, this first stage has a different
quality to it from that of concentration practice, and they attain to
direct and clear perception of the first knowledge of...</p>

1. MIND AND BODY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is this sudden
shift, and mental phenomena shift out away from the illusory sense of
“the watcher” and are just out there in the world with the
sensations of the other five sense doors. This is an important
insight, as it shows us clearly and directly that we are not “our”
mind or “our” body. It is also a really nice, clear and
unitive-feeling state (it really is still more state-like than
stage-like), and people can try to hold on to it just as with the
first jhana and get stuck. Reality can seem just a bit more brilliant
the first time one chances into Mind and Body. We may feel more alive
and connected to the world. With the sensate experience of both
mental and physical phenomena being clearly observable, the
relationships and interactions between the two begin to become
obvious. What is meant by “the dualistic split” is very obvious
during this first stage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Somewhere around the
first stage, either just before it or shortly after it, there may
arise odd jaw pains on one side, throat tensions, and some other such
unpleasant physical occurrences. Regardless, it soon becomes easy to
see that each sensation is followed by the crude mental impression of
it, and that intentions precede actions and thoughts (see the
discussion of impermanence in Part I, The Three Characteristics).
Thus, we come to...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5560_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_62"></a><a name="2__CAUSE_AND_EFFECT"></a>
2. CAUSE AND EFFECT</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In this stage, the
relationships between mental and physical henomena become very clear
and sometimes ratchet-like. The joy and wonder of Mind and Body have
left, and now the interactions between the mind and body become
somewhat mechanical seeming. Motions such as walking or the breath
may begin to get jerky, as there is the intention and the motion, the
sensation and the mental impression of it, the cause and the effect,
all occurring in a way which can seem sort of tight and robot-like.
You note, the breath moves just a bit. You stop noting, the breath
stops. You note quickly, the breath jerks quickly. You note slowly,
the breath follows. Some will stop noting quickly or stop noting at
all, thinking that they are messing up the breath. The advice here is
as before: note quickly, and don’t worry about what the breath
does.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember how I
recommended trying to experience one to ten sensations per second
consistently, noting which were mental and which were physical? At
this stage, the meditator is finally able to do this with a fair
degree of skill, confidence and consistency. Those with stronger
concentration tendencies or a bent towards such things may notice
thoughts and perhaps even visions of insight into cause and effect on
a macroscopic scale, where past action or circumstances lead to
various consequences, some event lead to some rebirth, some previous
life lead to something today, and in general may get a sense that
they are able to intuit aspects of the workings of karma in a way
they did not before. As the meditator becomes more clear about the
beginnings and endings of 172 each of these, about the irritation
caused by this jerkiness and about the fact that all of this seems to
be happening fairly on its own, they come to directly perceive for
themselves...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5562_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_63"></a><a name="3__THE_THREE_CHARACTERISTICS"></a>
3. THE THREE CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Three
Characteristics of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and egolessness
or no-self become predominant, which is good, as these are the
fundamental basis for insight. Here it begins to become quite clear
that these intentions and actions, sensations and the knowledge of
them, and all of the constituents of this experience are quickly
arising and passing, somewhat jarring, and not particularly in our
control or us. Further, as these sensations are all observed,
including the crude mental impression that follows them
(“consciousness”), the whole of the mind and body process is not
a separate self. It is merely a part of the interdependent world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These
characteristics become clearer and clearer, as well as faster and
faster, as the meditator diligently pays careful attention to exactly
what is happening at each moment. For those doing noting practice,
somewhere around here your speed and precision may begin to get so
fast that you cannot note every sensation you experience. Move to
more general noting, mono-syllabic noting (such as “beep” for
each sensation experienced regardless of what it was), or drop the
noting entirely and stay with noticing bare sensation come and go. At
this stage, practice begins to really take off despite the fact that
this stage tends to be fairly unpleasant.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This unpleasantness
tends to be mostly physical, though this stage can also cause
numerous dark feelings and a sense of wanting to renounce the world
and practice. Occasionally, the early part of this stage can cause
people to feel vulnerable, raw, and irritable to a small or large
degree in the ways that a migraine headache or a bad case of PMS can.
I have occasionally been laid out on a couch for hours by this aspect
of this stage, holding my head and just wishing that these early
stages didn’t sometimes involve so much pain and anguish.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There may be odd
bodily twistings, obsession with posture, and painful tensions or
strange other sensations, particularly in the back, neck, jaw and
shoulders. These tensions may persist when not meditating and be
quite irritating and even debilitating. The rhomboid 3 and trapezius
muscles are the most common offenders. It is common to try to sit
with good posture and then find one’s body twisting into some odd
and painful position. You straighten out, and soon enough it does it
again. That’s a very Three Characteristics sort of pattern. People
sometimes describe these feelings as some powerful energy that is
blocked and seems wants to get out or move through.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Feelings of heat and
sensations like those of a fever may sometimes accompany this stage.
One’s neck and back may become very stiff, either on one side or
both sides. The right and left sides of one’s body may feel quite
different from each other sometimes. The easiest way to get these
unpleasant physical manifestations to go away is to keep
investigating the Three Characteristics, either of them or of
whatever primary object you have chosen. These are common early
retreat experiences, particularly in the first few days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Fighting them or
trying other methods (backrubs, etc.) seems to either help only a
little, work only temporarily, or sometimes make them even worse,
though sometimes hatha yoga and related practices done with a high
degree of awareness can be helpful. This is a common time for people
to go to health practitioners of various kinds, from orthopedists and
dentists to chiropractors and body workers. For example, I had a
wisdom tooth removed during one pass through this stage because I
thought it was throwing my jaw out of alignment, and perhaps it was,
but this was clearly exacerbated by this stage of practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Even if these
unpleasant physical manifestations do slack off for a bit, they are
likely to keep coming back until one’s insight is sufficient to
progress beyond this part of this stage. Thus, should one find such
things interfering with one’s life, I recommend continued precise
and accepting practice. This is a phase of practice when strong
effort and very quick investigation really pay off.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Certain traditions
may look at such physical manifestations as “energy imbalances”
or in some other negative light, and I can see where they are coming
from, but I find those perspectives limiting. Rather, I see this
stage in its broader context as just one more phase of practice.
Others may invent very strange stories to explain these experiences.
A friend of mine ran into this ñana on retreat, found it very
unpleasant, stopped practicing and began to spin out all sorts of
fantastic stories in her head about how the poor fellow sitting next
to her was very angry and how it was making her tense. This didn’t
help whatsoever, and she got stuck there. I have learned to welcome
these odd manifestations as clearly recognizable markers of progress
on the path. They are clear objects for practice and reassure me that
I am on the right track. Unfortunately, this is a hard lesson to
teach others. True, these manifestations can suck, but being able to
appreciate what is happening in the face of the difficult stages is
important, and becomes much more important later on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As the mind gains
speed at really seeing each of the sensations of the mind and body
come and go, and the jerkiness from cause and effect can get quite
rapid and pronounced. These physical movements and spasms seem to
help break up the physical tension that may sometimes accompany this
stage, and are a sign of progress.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5564_1179888903"></a><a name="4__THE_ARISING_AND_PASSING_AWAY"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_64"></a>
4. THE ARISING AND PASSING AWAY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is also the
beginning of the second vipassana jhana. As in the second samatha
jhana, the applied and sustained effort or attention begin to drop
away, and meditation can seem to take on a life of its own. In the
early part of this stage, the meditator's mind speeds up more and
more quickly, and reality begins to be perceived as particles or fine
vibrations of mind and matter, each arising and vanishing utterly at
tremendous speed. The traditional texts actually call this stage the
beginning of insight practices, as from this point on there is a much
more direct and non-conceptual understanding of the Three
Characteristics.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stage is marked
by dramatically increased perceptual abilities when compared with the
previous stages. For example, one might be able to hone one’s
awareness to laser-like precision on the tip of one’s little finger
and seemingly be able to perceive the beginning and ending of every
single sensation that made up that finger. Spontaneous physical
movements and strange jerky breathing patterns that showed up in
Cause and Effect and became more pronounced in the Three
Characteristics may speed up significantly. This stage explains where
many practices such as Tibetan inner fire practices of the Yogic
breath of fire come from. It can also reveal the source material that
inspired teachings such as those about chakras and energy channels.
Many descriptions of Kundalini awakening are talking about this
stage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Reality is perceived
directly with great clarity, and great bliss, rapture, equanimity,
mindfulness, concentration, and other positive qualities arise.
Practice is extremely profound and sustainable, and there may be no
pain even after hours of sitting. Unfortunately, the positive
qualities that have arisen can easily become what are called the “Ten
Corruptions of Insight” if the true nature of the individual
sensations by which they are known are not understood as well, and
until this happens a meditator can easily get stuck in the immature
part of this stage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Ten Corruptions
of Insight are: illumination, knowledge, rapturous happiness,
tranquility, bliss, resolute confidence, exertion, assurance,
equanimity and attachment. To quote the great meditation master
Sayadaw U Pandita, from his great but very hard-to-find book, <u>On</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Path</u> <u>to</u> <u>Freedom</u>, “As for the
practicing yogi, he will at once recognize the above as imperfections
of insight not representing dhamma breakthrough and are only to be
noted off, remembering the teacher’s advice as to what is path and
not path. Being disabled by the ten imperfections, he would not be
capable of observing the triple characteristics in their true nature;
but once freed from imperfections, he is able to do so.” In short,
they may feel that they are now a very mighty meditator and that they
should try to hold on to this forever, i.e. they stop actually doing
insight practices and instead solidify these qualities as
concentration practice objects. Thus, the advice given about
deconstructing and investigating the positive factors of the samatha
jhanas, particularly the second one, is also very helpful when trying
to stay on the narrow path of the progress of insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Visions, unusual
sensory abilities (such as seeing nearby things through one’s
closed eyelids), out of body experiences, and especially bright
lights tend to arise to the meditator, sometimes first as jewel-tone
sparkles and then as a bright white light (“I have seen the
light!”). The technical meditator may easily sit for hours
dissecting their reality into extremely fine and fast sensations and
vibrations, perhaps even up to 40 per second or even more, with an
extremely high level of precision and consistency. (Where the absurd
and disheartening rumors of billions of mind moments per second come
from is beyond me). Fine vibrations may spread over the body,
revealing interference patterns between experiences, enabling one to
know directly that when one thing is experienced, in that instant,
something else is not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is very easy to
confuse this stage with descriptions of stage 11. Equanimity,
especially as the stage before it, 10. Re-observation, has some
distinct similarities to stage 3. The Three Characteristics. A brief
discussion of the fractal nature of things that describes this will
follow in the chapter called The Vipassana Jhanas. The big difference
is that this stage is ruled by quick cycles, rapidly changing
frequencies of vibrations, odd physical movements, strange breathing
patterns, heady raptures, a decreased need for sleep, strong bliss,
and a general sense of riding on a spiritual roller coaster with no
breaks. The higher stages (10 and 11) do not have those qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As to the cycles,
they tend to proceed as follows, with this description assuming that
you are using the breath as object. The mind kicks in, follows faster
and faster vibrations, things really engage and speed up, perhaps
accompanied by more pronounced shaking or strange breathing patterns
increasing in speed, and then finally half way down an out-breath
there is a shift, things drop down slowly, it takes work to stay with
things as they slow down, and then things bottom out. The breath may
stop entirely for a while. Then things come back up with the breath,
attention tends to flag, things relax, and then the cycle begins
again with things speeding up, etc. These breathing cycles may happen
quite on their own and may even be difficult to stop when we are
deeply into this stage. Those using visualizations as object, may
notice that the objects begin to spin with the phase of the breath,
or move in ways that they seem to have a life of their own, albeit a
two dimensional one, as compared to the three dimensional visions
that may arise later.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As this stage
deepens and matures, meditators let go of even the high levels of
clarity and the other strong factors of meditation, perceive even
these to arise and pass as just vibrations, not satisfy, and not be
self. They may plunge down into the very depths of the mind as though
plunging deep underwater to where they can perceive individual frames
of reality arise and pass with breathtaking clarity as though in slow
motion. It can even feel as if we have been submerged in thick syrup
and partially sedated with some strong, opiate-like drug.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">At the bottom of
these depths, however they present themselves, individual moments may
sometimes have a frozen quality to them, as if sensations were
stopping completely in the middle of their manifestation for just an
instant, and this way of experiencing reality is unique to this
stage. Somewhere in here is the entrance to the third vipassana jhana
in U Pandita's model, though there is some controversy about exactly
which insights line up with which vipassana jhanas from here on out.
I prefer to think of the Arising and Passing Away being purely second
vipassana jhana. I will discuss these controversies in the following
chapter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They may be able to
meditate with profound clarity even when asleep, and the need for
sleep may be greatly reduced. Wild “kundalini” phenomena are very
common at this point, including powerful physical shaking and
releases, explosions of consciousness like a fireworks display or a
tornado, visions, and especially vortexes of powerful fine
“electrical” vibrations blasting down one's spinal column and/or
between one's ears. These vortexes can be very loud. These sorts of
experiences can occur quite unexpectedly and even off the cushion,
such as in lucid dreams. They may be followed by various mixtures of
wonder, excitement, bliss, extraordinary joy, and sometimes
disorientation. It is not uncommon for those in the height of the
rapture of this stage to associate some of these occurrences with
those of an extended orgasm. None of these things are a problem
unless their true nature is not understood or unless they happen when
one is doing something like driving a car down an interstate at 75
miles per hour (a story for another time).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Strong sensual or
sexual feelings and dreams are common at this stage, and these may
have a non-discriminating quality that those attached to their notion
of themselves as being something other than partially bisexual may
find disturbing. Further, if you have unresolved issues around
sexuality, which we basically all have, you may encounter aspects of
them during this stage. This stage, its afterglow, and the almost
withdrawal-like crash that can follow seem to increase the temptation
to indulge in all manner of hedonistic delights, particularly
substances and sex. As the bliss wears off, we may find ourselves
feeling very hungry or lustful, craving chocolate, wanting to go out
and party, or something like that. If we have addictions that we have
been fighting, some extra vigilance near the end of this stage might
be helpful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stage also
tends to give people more of an extroverted, zealous or visionary
quality, and they may have all sorts of energy to pour into somewhat
idealistic or grand projects and schemes. At the far extreme of what
can happen, this stage can imbue one with the powerful charisma of
the radical religious leader.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Finally, at nearly
the peak of the possible resolution of the mind, they cross something
called “The Arising and Passing Event” (A&amp;P Event) or “Deep
Insight into the Arising and Passing Away.” This event marks a
profound shift in the meditator’s practice, and from then on they
will be somewhat changed by what they have seen, with this being the
Point of No Return that I mentioned in the Foreword and Warning. The
intensity of this event can vary, though it tends to be quite clear
and memorable, particularly the first time one crosses it during that
cycle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It should also be
noted that some people will have a big and obvious buildup to such
experiences and for others they will suddenly just show up completely
without warning, sometimes spontaneously and even without formal
meditation training, as happened to me at around age 15. I have a
number of friends who ran into these things without formal training
and in daily life, others who ran into them when doing hallucinogens
including mescaline and LSD, others during yoga practice, others
while around powerful spiritual figures, including one who had it
happen while hanging out with a Christian faith healer and a few who
were hanging out with various gurus.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Whatever context the
first A&amp;P Event happens in, that context will tend to hold a
special place in that person's heart from then on. For me it happened
on my own, by my own meditation efforts and without a tradition, and
so I have always associated my own practice with progress. My friend
who had it happen with the Christian faith healer became the most
hardcore Christian you could find. Another friend who had it happen
while on mescaline has since held a special place in her heart for
shamanism. Those who had it happen with gurus tended to follow those
gurus for some period of time, associating it with the gurus
presence. Some others who had it happen in an apparently random
context usually had no idea what it was or what it had done to them,
but most have realized that something was different and nearly all
remember it with an uncanny clarity as somehow standing out from
ordinary experiences.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Once one has
attained this event, it is fairly likely that one will be able to
attain the first stage of awakening sooner or later if one can
navigate the Dark Night skillfully (read: simply keep practicing).
Thus, a good first goal in insight meditation is to cross the A&amp;P
Event at one’s earliest possible convenience, with caveats given
later in the section on the Dark Night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The A&amp;P Event
can happen in three basic ways corresponding to the Three
Characteristics, just as can the entrance to insight stage 15.
Fruition, and the two are easily confused for this and other reasons.
There is great variation in the specifics of what we are seeing and
feeling when we cross this profound and intense event, but certain
aspects of these events will be common to all practitioners. This
event tends to manifest in a way that can mirror the Three Doors
(described in a few chapters) at about the middle of the out breath,
leading to an unknowing event, followed by a few exceedingly clearer
and more distinct moments imparting some deep understanding of the
Three Characteristics before a second unknowing event at the end of
the breath. It is not uncommon for the A&amp;P event to occur during
a particularly lucid dream or at least in the middle of the night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it should be
noted here that it is unlikely in these extreme moments for the sense
of the breath to be particularly clear, but this is how things happen
regardless. In these moments, most, <i>but</i> <i>not</i> <i>all</i>,
of their sensate universe strobes in and out of reality, arises and
passes. The subtle background and sense of an observer still seems to
stay stable. In contrast to this, the entrance to stage 15. Fruition
is through one of the Three Doors, involves the complete sensate
universe (background, time, space and all), happens at the end of the
out breath, and does not involve two closely related unknowing
events. (The usefulness of this information may become apparent later
on.)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Those who have
crossed the A&amp;P Event have stood on the ragged edge of reality
and the mind for just an instant, and they know that awakening is
possible. They will have great faith, may want to tell everyone to
practice, and are generally evangelical for a while. They will have
an increased ability to understand the teachings due to their direct
and non-conceptual experience of the Three Characteristics.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Philosophy that
deals with the fundamental paradoxes of duality will be less
problematic for them in some way, and they may find this fascinating
for a time. Those with a strong philosophical bent will find that
they can now philosophize rings around those who have not attained to
this stage of insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>They</i> <i>may</i>
<i>also</i> <i>incorrectly</i> <i>think</i> <i>that</i> <i>they</i>
<i>are</i> <i>enlightened</i>, as what they have seen was completely
spectacular and profound. In fact, this is strangely common for some
period of time, and thus may stop practicing when they have actually
only really begun.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is a common
time for people to write inspired dharma books, poetry, spiritual
songs, and that sort of thing. This is also the stage when people are
more likely to join monasteries or go on great spiritual quests. It
is also worth noting that this stage can look an awful lot like a
manic episode as defined in the DSM-IV (the current diagnostic manual
of psychiatry). The rapture and intensity of this stage can be
basically off the scale, the absolute peak on the path of insight,
but it doesn’t last.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Soon the meditator
will learn what is meant by the phrase, “Better not to begin. Once
begin, better to finish!” as they are now too far into this to ever
really go back. Until they complete this progress of insight, they
are “on the ride” and may begin to feel that the dharma is now
doing them rather than the other way around, as they will progress
inevitably and relatively quickly, usually within days, into stages
5-10, which as you will shortly see, are not always a party. The
rapture and all the bells and whistles die down quickly, and the
meditator may even be left raw as if hung over after a night of wild
partying. The clarity fades somewhat, and the endings of objects
becomes predominant as they progress to knowledge of...</p>

5. DISSOLUTION, ENTRANCE TO THE DARK NIGHT</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus begins what are
called the “Knowledges of Suffering” or “The Dark Night of the
Soul” (to use St. John of the Cross’ terminology). I consider
this the entrance to the third vipassana jhana, though U Pandita
considers this the entrance to the fourth vipassana jhana. I'll give
1 my arguments for this later in the chapter that deals more directly
with the vipassana jhanas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Dark Night spans
stages 5 through 10 in this map, namely Dissolution, Fear, Misery,
Disgust, Desire for Deliverance, and Re-observation. Stages 5 through
9 tend to “come as a package,” with one leading fairly quickly
and naturally to the others. Stage 10, Re-observation, tends to stand
out as its own distinct and often formidable entity. It should be
noted that some pass through the Dark Night quickly and some slowly.
Some barely notice it, and for some it is a huge deal, regardless of
the speed at which one moves through these stages. Some may get run
over by it on one retreat, fall back, and then pass through it with
no great difficulties some time later. Others may struggle for years
to learn its lessons.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I am going to
describe the Dark Night largely in extreme terms, but realize that
this is just to give a heads up to what is possible, not what is
necessary or guaranteed. As before, on retreat these things are
likely to be more intense and clear, though those on retreat who are
able to keep practicing are likely to make much faster progress as
well. On the other hand, practice in “daily life” can be powerful
and sometimes very speedy. These things are strangely unpredictable.
Enough disclaimers!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Once someone has
crossed the Arising and Passing Event, one will enter the Dark Night
regardless of whether one wants to or not. It doesn’t matter if you
practice from this point on; once you cross the A&amp;P you are in
the Dark Night to some degree (i.e. are a Dark Night Yogi) until you
figure out how to get through it, and if you do get through it
without getting to the first stage of enlightenment, you will have to
go through it again and again until you do. I mean this in the most
absolute terms.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Dark Night
typically begins with just about all of the profound clarity,
mindfulness, concentration, focus, equanimity and bliss of the
previous stage dropping away. So also ends the cause-and-effect-like
phenomena of the breath or walking shaking or jerking up and down in
a way related to attention and noting, as well as all of the fine
vibrations and vortex-like raptures. Early on, the frequency of
vibrations disconnects from the cycle of the breath, remaining
largely stable at whatever frequency is going on at that stage once
they can be perceived again (in late Dissolution or Fear).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Whereas one might
have felt that one’s attention had finally attained the one-pointed
focus that is so highly valued in most ideals of meditation during
the Arising and Passing Away, during the Dark Night one will have to
deal with the fact that one’s attention is actually quite wide and
its contents unstable. Further, the center of one’s attention
becomes the very least clear area of experience, and the periphery
becomes predominant. This is normal and even expected by those who
know this territory. However, most meditators are not expecting this
at all and so get blindsided and wage a futile battle to make their
attention do something that, in this part of the path, it simply
won’t do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If one has ever been
meditating in a place with lots of mosquitoes buzzing in one’s ears
in a way that made it very hard to concentrate on the primary object,
one can get a sense of what one’s attention will be like in the
Dark Night. Rather than fighting against this and ignoring the
metaphorical mosquitoes, one should try to understand what it feels
like to have one’s attention be however it is. Just like listening
to discordant, chromatic jazz with lots of jarring harmonies and
instruments playing more at odds with each other than together takes
some getting used to, the quality of attention in the Dark Night is
an acquired taste, and the sensations that arise tend to be very
rich, complex, broad and unsettling. Those that fixate on staying
one-pointed will suffer more than those who learn to stay with what
is going on regardless of whether or not it feels like “good
meditation.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In that same vein,
those who are using some other object as a focus will notice the same
phenomena of the width of attention being wider and the basic sense
that attention seems to sort of be out of phase with phenomena. Those
doing visualizations may notice that they see a black spot in the
center of their attention with some sort of patterns or visions
around the edge of it spreading wider and wider out into the
periphery. Those using a mantra may feel that the mantra is out of
phase with attention, wide and complex and yet hard to stay with, and
may acquire more complex harmonics and harmonies if it is in any way
musical, like listening to a large, ghost chorus that is off to the
sides of you, whereas before the mantra may have felt centered in the
stereo field of attention. There will be individual variation in some
aspects of these things, depending on object, focus, ability, and
each person's particular proclivities, but some basic aspects will be
universal, and I will talk more about these aspects in the later
chapter on the Vipassana Jhanas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are two basic
patterns of vibrations in the Dark Night, and they are actually the
Dark Night’s defining characteristics. One may get overwhelmed by
the descriptions of emotional difficulties, but keep these patterns
in mind and try to stay on that level. One is fairly slow, somewhat
regular and chunky, at perhaps 5-7 Hz, with not much else going on.
It’s an early Dark Night thing and it tends to feel like a shamanic
drum beat. The later pattern is fairly fast, perhaps 10-18+ Hz, a bit
more irregular, and has faster and slower harmonics in the background
and around the periphery of our attention. It tends to make us feel
very buzzy and edgy. The fact that the background is beginning to
shake is a good sign of progress, as this needs to happen for the
cycle to be completed. On the other hand, it is exactly the fact that
the background has begun to shake and crumble that can cause people
to freak out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Things were all fun
and games when the primary object was shaking, but when the sense of
the observer starts to shake, that can be creepy. Simply pay careful
attention to exactly what is happening, staying with each pulse of
each vibration as clearly as you can, trying to see each from its
beginning to its end. Chances are you will be just fine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are two basic
things that happen during the Dark Night, one emotional, the other
perceptual. Our dark stuff tends to come bubbling up to the surface
with a volume and intensity that we may never have known before.
Remembering what is good in our life can be difficult in the face of
this, and our reactivity in the face of our dark stuff can cause us
staggering amounts of needless suffering. On top of this, we also
begin to directly experience the fundamental suffering of duality, a
suffering that has always been with us but which we have never known
with this level of intensity or ever clearly understood. We face a
profound and fundamental crisis of identity as our insight into the
Three Characteristics begins to demolish part of the basic illusion
of there being a separate or permanent us. This suffering is a kind
of suffering that has nothing to do with what happens in our life and
everything to do with a basic misunderstanding of all of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Dealing with either
of these two issues, i.e. our dark stuff and our fundamental crisis
of identity, would be a difficult undertaking, but trying to deal
with them both at the same time is at least twice as difficult and
can sometimes be overwhelming. It goes without saying that we tend
not to be at our best when we are overwhelmed in this way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The knee-jerk
response often is to try to make our minds and our world change so as
to try to stop the suffering we experience. However, when we are
deeply into the Dark Night, we could be living in paradise and not be
able to appreciate this at all, and so this solution is guaranteed to
fail. Thus, my strong advice is to work on finishing up this cycle of
insight and then work on your stuff from a place of insight and
balance, rather than trying to do it in the reactive and disorienting
stages of the Dark Night! I cannot make this point strongly enough.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As a close friend of
mine with a ton of experience in insight practices and a gift for
precise language and teaching so aptly put it, “The Dark Night can
really fuck up your life.” However, I will give you two hard-won
pieces of advice that I have found have made the difference in the
face of these stages. First, make the time to do basic insight
practices. Do your very best to get sufficient insight into the Three
Characteristics so as to get past this stage! Make time for retreats
or alone time and don’t get stuck in the Dark Night. You and
everyone around you will be happy that you did so.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The second piece of
advice is to have a “no-bleedthrough” policy when you suspect you
are in the Dark Night. Simply refuse to let your negativity bleed out
onto everyone and everything around you. Failure to do so can be
disastrous, as your profound lack of perspective, fixation on
negativity and the suffering from your fundamental crisis of identity
can easily get projected out onto things and people that simply did
not cause that suffering! No one appreciates this at all and it does
no good whatsoever.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Combining these two
pieces of important advice, resolve thus, “I have recently crossed
the A&amp;P Event and I know this by the many obvious signs of that
stage. Now I am feeling strangely reactive and negative about things
that I ordinarily am able to handle with more balance and clarity,
and I know that a good part of this is due to the inevitable Dark
Night that follows the A&amp;P. I realize that I am in a less than
ideal position to skillfully deal with the personal issues that are
driving me crazy, as I am likely to project the suffering from the
illusion of duality and the odd side effects of the Dark Night onto
these issues.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I have been
warned that this is an extremely bad idea from those who have
successfully navigated in this territory, and I have faith that they
know what they are talking about. Even if these issues are real and
valid, I am likely to blow them way out of proportion and not be able
to bring balance and kindness to them. By contracting into my own
reactive darkness and confusion, I could easily hurt others and
myself. Thus, I resolve to keep my darkness to myself, tell only
those who are skilled in navigating in dark territory, or at least
share it with others in a way that does not project it out on my
world and them, and so will spare those around me needless suffering
which they do not deserve. In short, I will use the meditation map
theory to keep the reins on my dark stuff and to deal with it in ways
that are known to help rather than harm.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“I will make time
for insight practices and retreats during which time I will simply
see the true nature of the sensations of whatever arises, however
horrible or compelling, and not indulge in the content of my stuff
for one skinny instant if this is within the limits of my strength
and power. In this way, I will be able to navigate this territory
skillfully and not damage my daily life. Should I fail, I will
actively seek help from those who are skilled in helping people keep
a healthy perspective in the face of dark issues until such time as I
can face the Dark Night as recommended.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“When I have
attained to the first stage of awakening, that will be a great time
to see how much of my negativity was really valid and how much was
just due to my own lack of clarity and the side effects of the Dark
Night. From that place of clarity, I will be much more likely to fix
those things in my life that really need fixing and attention and be
able to dismiss easily those paper tigers that I have created for
myself. By not trying to take on all of this at once, that is, by
gaining deep insights before tackling the personal issues, I am more
likely to lead the happy and wise life I wish for myself. I will
attain to both liberating insights and insights into my issues, and
this will be of great benefit to myself and all beings.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of the primary
reasons that I wrote this book was to write this important
resolution. I have suffered needlessly and sometimes profoundly from
the failure of myself and those I love to follow this resolution.
They have also. Were you hearing me say these things to you rather
than simply reading them, you would see tears in my eyes and hear my
voice cracking with sorrow as I recall those past events and even
reflect on what is happening around me as I write this. I beg you,
for the sake of all that is good in this world, do not fail to heed
this advice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Unfortunately, not
everyone seems to be able to do this. In fact, not everyone is even
willing to attempt to follow this advice, particularly those who buy
into the dangerous paradigm that “whatever I feel right now is
real” in the sense that their feelings at that moment must be the
only possible valid perspective on their current situation and are
thus completely justified along with their reactions to those
feelings. There are those who simply don’t believe that such a
wondrous and holy thing as insight practices could produce such
profound difficulties. There are also those who do not believe in the
maps or that the maps could possibly apply to their own very special
and unique life. Lastly, there are a few whose pride and insecurity
issues will not allow them to admit that they might be affected by
the Dark Night in this way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I would warn such
people to STAY THE FUCK OUT OF THE DARK NIGHT until they come to a
place where they might be able to approximate at least some aspects
of the above-mentioned resolution or apply the basics of the theory
behind it. That means that if you are not willing to at least try to
make and live by some version of my recommended resolution, you
should not do insight practices and should not cross the A&amp;P
Event. Yes, I am a little bitter. Bitterness comes and goes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I am a big fan of
fast sports cars, but I wouldn’t give one to a six-year-old kid.
Just so, I am a big fan of insight practices, obviously, but I have
come to the conclusion that those who are not willing to use them
responsibly and intelligently should not use them, as it is too
dangerous. They cause too much trouble in the world to be of little
if any benefit. This is not likely to be a popular view, but I have
experienced too much of what can go wrong when people fail to try to
live up to such a resolution to come to any other conclusion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The problem is that
some people cross into the Dark Night without doing formal insight
practices. I did when I was about 15 and had no idea what was going
on. How to reach these people I have no idea, but they tend to come
wandering into spiritual communities soon enough. I hope they find
people there who help them sort out what has happened to them can
tell them the above advice. I my naïve dreams I imagine that one day
there would be training on the maps and basic spiritual development
in some generic, non-sectarian way in elementary school, just as we
learn about biology and mathematics, and so would be just another
ordinary, accepted, standard part of human education, and so everyone
would know about these things as if they were the ordinary, natural
things they were, but we are a long way from that now, and so
hopefully a few who run into this technology will help spread it
around and help people who have crossed the A&amp;P Event to
recognize it and handle it properly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This resolution and
the spirit implied by it are an aspect of training in morality, and
this sort of morality is one of our best friends in the Dark Night.
When we adopt the spirit of this resolution, we do our conscious best
to craft our way of being so as to be kind and compassionate. Many
people have commented that insight training is a “monastic
practice.” If we are able to build our own virtual monastery
through skillful speech and skillful action, then we do not need a
monastery to protect us and the world from the potential side effects
of our practices. We can live skillfully in the ordinary world and
still make progress in insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, there are
those who are willing to buy the theory and spirit inherent in the
above resolution but are so swamped by their personal issues that
they simply cannot follow the above advice after they get into the
Dark Night despite their kind and skillful intention to do so. My
advice to them is to diligently and quickly seek professional help in
the form of psychotherapists and their ilk until such time as they
are able to follow something like the above-mentioned resolution.
Realize that this is not an optimal way to go, as the inherent lack
of perspective of the Dark Night makes aspects of the therapeutic
process more difficult, but for some there will be no other option
and this solution is better than simply floundering. On the other
hand, at least such people have tons of stuff bubbling loudly up for
them to deal with, making some aspects of the therapeutic process
easier. However, I would try to do just enough healing so that you
can push on to the first stage of awakening with minimal bleed
through and then finish whatever therapeutic process you began in the
Dark Night after you are out of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There another
seemingly positive way of looking at the Dark Night, or the
Knowledges of Suffering, one that doesn't really fit well with our
mainstream ideals of how life should be. It is the view of the
renunciate, which basically says, “Ah, now you see the pain of your
materialistic life, of your cravings that will never bring you
happiness, of your worldly attachments, and that house of cards you
call a life. Far better to give it all up and take up the way of the
dharma.” While I have generally advised doing completely otherwise,
I can completely understand why one would do this. However, the
problem comes when we have things like debt, children, aging parents
and the like, and sorting out the ethics of these conflicts is
complex. Regardless, the Dark Night does teach important lessons, and
learning them is essential to moving to what comes next. These
lessons do not require specific lifestyle choices for mastery.
Instead, it is a question of clear perception of, you guessed it, the
Three Characteristics of the sensations that occur during those
stages. As I mentioned in Part I, each training has a specific kind
of renunciation associated with it, and they couldn't be more
different.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is time to get
back to describing Dissolution. As the stage of the Arising and
Passing Away ends, the meditator may be left feeling raw and
incompetent despite the fact that they are continuing to make
valuable progress into deeper and deeper levels of profound insight.
This feeling that something is wrong when things are actually getting
better and better can cause all sorts of problems during the Dark
Night, especially to those not familiar with the standard maps.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
having come through the A&amp;P territory can be quite a relief, and
so sometimes Dissolution can seem quite welcome. Some will stop
practicing here, as they feel they have “released the Kundalini”
and so are done for the time being. Dissolution feels like a very
natural place to stop practicing, the only problem being that the
later stages (Fear and the rest) tend to follow it soon enough even
if one stops, though less intense practice leads to a less intense,
if often prolonged, Dark Night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, those who
wish to keep doing formal practice may find Dissolution frustrating.
Whereas just one stage ago they could sit for hours and perceive the
finest vibrations of reality in exquisite detail, now reality appears
to be slipping away, vague, and hard to get a handle on. Whereas we
may have had stellar posture in the previous stage, now we go back to
being ordinary mortals. Images of the body may even seem to
completely disappear, similar to that which happens in formless
realms but without the clarity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Practice is likely
to be more difficult, and we may experience pain from sitting that
was basically completely absent during the previous stage. This can
be extremely frustrating for those who don’t know that this is
normal, and the desire to re-attain a fading past can greatly
interfere with being present. In the face of these difficulties, I
highly recommend noting practice. It may seem like a step back to
some who abandoned it during the glory of the A&amp;P, but the
spiritual path is not a linear one. In the face of Dissolution and
the stages that follow, noting practice can be very useful and
powerful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In short, if they
are able to keep practicing (familiar theme yet?) and adjust to
having to actually work to perceive things clearly again, they will
begin to make further progress. This time the effort will have to be
with a lighter and wider touch. Note well, if they give up in the
stages of the Dark Night (or any time after the A&amp;P Event), the
qualities of the Dark Night will almost certainly continue to haunt
them in their daily life, sapping their energy and motivation, and
perhaps even causing feelings of unease, perhaps depression and even
paranoia. Thus, the wise meditator is very, very highly encouraged to
try to maintain their practice despite the potential difficulties so
as to avoid getting stuck in these stages!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think of
Dissolution as the couch potato stage, though it can also have a
sense of sensual languor to it. A hallmark of Dissolution is that it
is suddenly hard to avoid getting lost in thought and fantasy when
meditating. We may feel somehow disconnected from our life. Another
effect that can be very noticeable at this stage is that actions just
don’t happen easily. For instance, you might be going to lift your
hand to turn off your alarm clock, but your hand just doesn’t move.
You could move your hand, but somehow things just tend to stop with
the intention and get nowhere. Eventually you move your hand, but it
might have been just a bit tiring to do so. That’s what Dissolution
can feel like. Meditation can be the same way, and until one breaks
out of this, things can get a bit mired down in the overstuffed
cushions of Dissolution. However, when the perception of things
ending becomes clearer again, there arises...</p>

6. FEAR</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The clarity and
intensity begin to return, but now this stage can involve all sorts
of frightening distortions of perception when sitting, accompanied by
great feelings of unease, paranoia, fearfulness, and/or “the
willies.” It can even sometimes seem that our body is falling in
tatters through the floor or that we are rotting away. If we have
strong concentration tendencies, we may see horrifying or
disconcerting visions. Vibrations from here on out should no longer
change frequency with the phase of the breath as they did in stage 4
and for the next few stages tend to be slower than those in that
previous stage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Strangely, Fear can
also be a just a bit rapturous in the ways that a horror movie can be
or in the way that riding a roller coaster at night can be
simultaneously scary and exciting. However, the nice side of this
stage tends to be greatly overshadowed by the dark side. We are being
asked to accept the full range of life here as it is. Acceptance and
clear, precise awareness of the true nature of the actual sensations
that make up all of this are the key in all of the Dark Night stages
as before. On the mild side, this stage might manifest as just a
slightly heightened sense of non-specific anxiety. As fear passes and
our reality continues to strobe in and out and fall away, we are left
feeling...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5570_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_67"></a><a name="7__MISERY"></a>
7. MISERY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stage can be
characterized by great feelings of sadness and loss. Again, there can
almost be something nice about the heartfelt depth of these feelings,
but this tends to be greatly overshadowed by the dark side of them.
We are having our whole concept of self and the world as being
permanent, able to satisfy, and even being us or separate from us
being torn down and violated by the now undeniable truth of the Three
Characteristics. There can be a lot of grieving in this process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is hard to
accept, and our resistance to this process causes us misery. Becoming
lost in the content of these sensations and being unable to see their
true nature is a somewhat common cause of failure to progress and
failure to live healthily. On the mild side, we may just feel a bit
like after we do after we have been crying. Misery is the transition
point between the Drum-like 5-8Hz part of the Dark Night and the very
complex, irritating frequencies that follow. Attention continues to
get wider and the center more blind. As things continue to fall
apart, clearly demonstrate their unsatisfactoriness and their
selflessness, this can cause...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5572_1179888903"></a><a name="8__DISGUST"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_68"></a>
8. DISGUST</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We become disgusted
with the whole thing. This is where the buzzy 10-18+ Hz chaotic
vibrations around the periphery really begin to get strong. Through
this section of the Dark Night, our ability to see objects in the
center of our attention is poor, and it may feel like our minds are
being stretched wide and yet contracting at the same time. We begin
to feel completely tormented by our noisy and repetitious minds (a
classic sign of this stage), by a body that is full of suffering and
unpleasant sensations, and by a world that is falling apart.
Perceiving thoughts as thoughts gets harder and harder, and thus
getting caught by our stuff gets increasingly easier. On the mild
side, one might just feel subtly revolted and disappointed with
reality in general, or perhaps have the slightly creepy feeling of
crawling skin. On the strong side, we see nothing to cling to, no
self to be found, and we begin to wish the whole edgy thing would
just end, also called...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5574_1179888903"></a><a name="9__DESIRE_FOR_DELIVERANCE"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_69"></a>
9. DESIRE FOR DELIVERANCE</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">At this stage, we
are fed up with the whole thing, but at a level that transcends mere
suicidal thoughts. Thus, it is actually beneficial though it seems
otherwise. No longer do we look forward to anything but the complete
ending of all sensations, i.e. the first taste of Nirvana. We just
wish the noise in our minds would stop cold, but are unable to will
this to happen. We wish the vibrations, which can be quite intense,
harsh and irritating by this stage, would all go away forever. If we
fail to associate the pain ending with deep insights but instead
falsely associate it with changing something in our ordinary life, we
are likely to wander far and wide until we come to realize the
limitations of ordinary solutions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is the stage
when people are most likely to quit their jobs or schooling out of
frustration and go on a long retreat or spiritual quest. Fascination
with celibacy as somehow being “a higher spiritual path” can
arise. Our renunciation trip can be very disorienting to partners,
particularly if we were going to the opposite extreme of intense
sexuality during the stage of the Arising and Passing Away which
probably occurred relatively recently, so try to be sensitive to
their needs if you can. Somewhere in here, there can arise the
tendency to try to get one’s life and finances in order so that one
can leave the world behind for a time and have something to come back
to without having to worry about such things for a while. A profound
resolution to push onward can arise at this stage driven by our
powerful frustration and the powerful compassion in it. We make the
last push for freedom, the push against the seemingly impenetrable
wall of...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5576_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_70"></a><a name="10__RE_OBSERVATION"></a>
10. RE-OBSERVATION</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stage may not
sound like much of a problem, as it has such a boring-sounding name,
but this stage is often, though not always, like a brick wall,
particularly the first few times we run into it. It can be as if all
of the stages of the Dark Night converge again for one last important
lesson, the lesson of Re-observation. We must perceive the true
nature of the sensations that make up all of our ideas of perfection,
all of the ideals we cling to, all images of how the world should be
and shouldn’t be, all desire for anything to be other than the way
that it is as well as all desire for enlightenment that is anything
other than this. It may seem impossible to sit for even a minute, as
the levels of restlessness and aversion to meditation and all
experience can get quite high. This stage and part of stage 3 (The
Three Characteristics) can share some common features. This should be
seen as a strong warning to those who are prone to being overly
certain about “where they are.” I get a reasonable number of
emails from people who claim they are sure they 3 are in
re-observation, and shortly thereafter they are describing A&amp;P
territory, meaning that they had just been in The Three
Characteristics territory, not Re-observation. Continuing to
investigate the true nature of these sorts of sensations and our map
theories is often difficult, and this is a common cause of failure to
progress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I am about to
describe all sorts of emotional or psychological manifestations that
can sometimes happen at this stage. The more extreme the description
of a possible side-effect of this stage, the rarer that side-effect
is likely to be, particularly those that sound like descriptions of
mental illness. For someone who is staying at the level of bare
sensate experience, as I strongly recommend, the only difficult
manifestations that seem to be quite common are a strong sense of
aversion to formal meditation and experience, and a deep sense of
primal frustration, <i>though</i> <i>these</i> <i>tend</i> <i>to</i>
<i>fall</i> <i>quickly</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>face</i> <i>of</i>
<i>good</i> <i>practice</i>, and if our concentration is strong
enough and our other factors are in balance, we may move through this
stage with no problem at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The aversion to
meditation and experience are due to the fact that the vibrations by
this point can be quite fast and harsh and the noise in our
repetitive minds quite irritating. Some of my own descriptions of
this stage while on retreat have included such phrases as “the
mindstorm” and “a bracing work in D minor for six sense doors,
hailstorm and stuttering banshee.” If we are very powerful
meditators, it can literally feel as if we will be torn apart by
these vibrations, and this is exactly what we are trying to
accomplish. Even if the other odd manifestations do arise, if we are
practicing well they should not last very long at all, at best
minutes, at worst hours or days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">All of that said,
and before I go on, those who are crossing this territory with strong
concentration abilities and using some very rarefied object, such as
a complex visualization on sacred geometry as one of many possible
examples, may, if they are very good, pass through this stage with
little or no difficulty at all, and all they may notice is that the
thing gets wider and wider, the patterns get more complex and attain
to wider, more spherical dimensions and perhaps many-fold symmetries,
and that it comes around to encompass basically the whole field of
experience, kind of like watching an IMAX movie of a moving
technicolor spirograph in the front row, or some similar thing. I use
this example partly due to my own experiments and partly to
illustrate general points. Different objects will produce different
specifics, such as colors, images, etc., while some universal aspects
of what happens during this stage will remain basically the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You see,
<i>Re</i>-<i>observation</i> <i>is</i> <i>actually</i> <i>all</i>
<i>fluff</i> <i>and</i> <i>no</i> <i>substance</i>, <i>but</i> <i>if</i>
<i>you</i> <i>confuse</i> <i>fluff</i> <i>for</i> <i>substance</i>,
<i>the</i> <i>effect</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> <i>the</i> <i>same</i>
<i>as</i> <i>if</i> <i>it</i> <i>actually</i> <i>had</i> <i>substance</i>.
It is like a toothless dog with a ferocious bark. If you run
screaming or faint from fear when the dog barks, then it needed no
teeth to prevent your progress. The corollary is that the primary
sign that the negative side effects that may occur in the Dark Night
are actually not associated with insight stages but instead are due
to other processes is that they do not change much in the face of
strong and accepting investigation or stopping practice entirely.
That said...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stage is
sometimes called the “rolling up the mat stage” and is when many
who joined monasteries in the stage of the Arising and Passing Away
now give up and disrobe. People on retreats tend to need lots of
reassurance and often leave right then even with good guidance and
encouragement. There can be the distinct feeling that it is
impossible to go forward and useless to go back, which is exactly the
lesson they should learn. Acceptance of right here and right now is
required, even if it seems that this mind and this body are quite
unacceptable and unworthy of investigation. No sensations are
unworthy of investigation!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of the hallmarks
of the early part of this stage is that we may begin to clearly see
exactly what our minds do all day long, see with great clarity how
the illusion of a dualistic split is even created in the first place
sensation by sensation, moment to moment, but somehow there is not
yet enough spaciousness of perspective and equanimity to make good
use of this information. This can be very frustrating, as we wonder
how many times we have to learn these lessons before they stick.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Great feelings of
frustration and disenchantment with life, relationships, sex, jobs,
moral codes and “worldly” responsibilities may sometimes emerge
at this stage in ways that can cause all sorts of disruption and
angst. These aspects of one’s life can <i>temporarily</i> seem
bland and pointless at this stage, though it may seem that this will
always be the way one feels about them. This stage can mimic or
perhaps manifest as some degree of clinical depression. Beware of
making radical life changes that cannot easily be undone (such as a
divorce), or firing off angry emails to your boss based upon the
temporary feelings that may arise during this stage. For those that
recognize that they are in this stage, some sort of active mental
compensation for these potential effects can be helpful so as to keep
one’s life functioning. It can help one appear more “together”
than one feels, and thus maintain relationships, jobs, studies, etc.
at some sort of functional level. This can be very skillful if it is
also combined with practice that allows the experiences of this stage
to be acknowledged and understood as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Layers of unhelpful
and previously hidden expectation, pressure and anxiety can show
their true uselessness, though this beneficial process can be very
confusing and difficult. We may get the sense that we have never had
such a strong feeling life, and until we get used to this new
awareness of our previously subtle emotions, this stage can be quite
overwhelming. Occasionally, people can also have what can seem like
full psychotic breaks during this stage, though if these are truly a
side effect of insight practices they should pass quickly. The big
trick here is to continue to acknowledge and accept the content but
also continue to see the true nature of the sensations that make up
these natural phenomena. This can be extremely hard to do, especially
if people have chanced upon this stage without the benefit of the
guidance of a well-developed insight tradition and teachers who can
recognize this territory.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Those who do not
know what to do with this stage or who get overwhelmed by the mind
states can get so lost in the content that they begin to lose it.
This is the far extreme of what can happen in this stage. Fear is
frightening, misery is miserable, and seemingly psychotic episodes
are very confusing and destabilizing. In the face of such
experiences, we may swing to the opposite extreme, clinging
desperately to grandiose images of ourselves. These things can easily
perpetuate themselves, and this can become a blatantly destructive
mental habit if people persist in wallowing in these dark emotions
and their deep and unresolved issues for too long. It can be like
cognitive restructuring from Hell. If the content continues to be
bought without the ability to see its true nature, then the mind can
spiral down and down into madness and despair. When people mention
“touching their own madness” on the spiritual path, they are
often talking about this stage. This stage can make people feel
claustrophobic and tight. If they push to make progress, they can
feel that they are just getting wound up tighter and tighter. If they
do nothing then they are still suffering anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The advice here is:
stick with it but don’t try to force it. Pay attention to balancing
effort and acceptance. Remember that discretion is the better part of
valor. Practice in moderation as well as maintaining a longterm view
can be helpful. Think of practice as a life-long endeavor, but do
just what you can each day. Stay present-oriented. Walks in nature or
places with large, expansive views can help, as can exercise. This
stage has the power to profoundly purify us, given sufficient
commitment to just trying to sit with it, be clear, precise and
accept all this despite the pain and anguish, both physical and
mental, that it can bring. <i>If</i> <i>on</i> <i>retreat</i>: <i>sit</i>
<i>and</i> <i>walk</i> <i>according</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i>
<i>schedule</i>, <i>apply</i> <i>the</i> <i>technique</i> <i>as</i>
<i>prescribed</i> <i>every</i> <i>second</i> <i>if</i> <i>humanly</i>
<i>possible</i>, <i>and</i> <i>do</i> <i>not</i> <i>leave</i> <i>early</i>!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stage is
actually a profound opportunity to see clearly the pain of the
dualistic aspect of our attachments, aversions, desires, hopes, fears
and ideals, as all this has been amplified to an unprecedented level.
It is this stage that makes possible the path of heroic effort,
diligent investigation of this moment based upon the powerful desire
for enlightenment, as at this stage all of the unskillful aspects of
this desire are beaten out of the meditator with a force equivalent
to the suffering caused by them. You can actually get very far on
highly imbalanced and goal-oriented practice, and it can give
sufficient momentum and meditation skills so that, should you get
your ass kicked in this stage, one continues making progress quickly
anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, if the
meditator stops practicing here, they can get stuck and haunted by
this stage in the whole of their life until they complete this first
progress of insight. Their lack of practice will deprive them of the
primary benefits of this stage (i.e., the increased perceptual
abilities that allowed them to get this much insight in the first
place) and reduce their chances of getting beyond it, and yet the
emotional consequences can remain long after the skills in meditation
have faded. They can become “Chronic Dark Night Yogis,”
meditators that somehow just don’t figure out how to get past this
stage for very long periods of time. You would be surprised by how
many of these people there are out there. Their failure to unstick
themselves may be due to their own psychological makeup, poor
instruction, imagining that the spiritual life is all about bliss and
wonderful emotions, believing in absurd models of spirituality that
do not allow for the full range of the emotional and mental life, or
chancing upon this stage outside of a well-developed insight
tradition, which is what happened to me at about age 15. I was a
Chronic Dark Night Yogi for 10 years without having any idea what the
hell was happening to me, so I can speak on this topic with some
authority. Further, I have gone through numerous other Dark Nights at
the higher stages of awakening and come across the same issues again
and again. Being stuck in the Dark Night can manifest as anywhere
from chronic mild depression and free-floating anxiety to serious
delusional paranoia and other classic mental illnesses, e.g.
narcissism and delusions of grandeur (my personal favorites). Dark
Night Yogis may act with a strange mixture of dedicated spirituality
and darkness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mentioned that the
A&amp;P Event could impart a bit of the inspirational, radical
religious leader quality to those prone to such things. For these
same individuals, Stage 10 can sometimes have a bit of the paranoid,
apocalyptic cult leader quality to it, a confused whirlwind of
powerful inspiration and despair. Just because someone has borderline
or antisocial personality disorder doesn't mean they can't make
progress in insight, and when they hit these stages it can be pretty
wild.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We may all have our
own particular neurotic tendencies that come out when we are under
stress, but if you feel that you are really losing it: get help,
particularly from those who know this territory firsthand and are
willing to talk honestly about it! Don’t be a macho meditator and
get stuck, and don’t imagine that spiritual practice can’t cause
some wild and sometimes unpleasant side effects. One of the best
things about working with a thoroughly qualified and realized insight
meditation teacher before we get into this sort of trouble is that
they will have some idea of our baseline level of sanity and balance
and thus know what we are capable of.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That said, I suspect
that both the Mushroom Factor and the dharma jet set culture of
teachers popping in and out with little chance for students to have
meaningful contact with them off retreat contributes to the
non-trivial number of Dark Night Yogis out there. I suspect that
there are fewer problems with Chronic Dark Night Yogis in traditions
where the maps of what can happen in this territory are well known
and in which there are teachers who are very accessible and honest
about their humanity and the possible range of the spiritual terrain.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
sometimes genuine mental illness or unrelated emotional or
psychological difficulties can show up in people’s lives. Blaming
it all on the Dark Night may not always be accurate or helpful,
though if you have recently crossed the A&amp;P Event and not
completed an insight cycle or gotten into the next stage
(Equanimity), there is going to be some Dark Night component mixed in
with whatever else is going on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Meditation
traditions tend to attract what can seem like more than their fair
share of the spiritual, emotional and mental equivalents of the
walking wounded. Sorting out what is what can sometimes get murky and
may require the help of both those who know this insight territory
and those who deal with routine mental illness and emotional and
psychological difficulties. The best combination would be someone who
knows both. I have a highly enlightened friend who has found it very
useful to take medication to treat his bipolar disorder. There is
something very down-to-earth and realistic about that. These
practices won’t save us from our biology. They merely reveal
something in the relationship to it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
there are those that are so deeply indoctrinated by the models of
“working through” our “dark stuff” that whenever it comes up
they turn to psychotherapy or a whole host of other ways of getting
their issues to “resolve” or go away. This view implies false
solidity and an exaggerated importance to these things that can make
it very hard to see the true nature of the sensations that make them
up. <i>The</i> <i>trap</i> <i>here</i> <i>is</i> <i>that</i> <i>we</i>
<i>turn</i> <i>a</i> <i>basic</i> <i>crisis</i> <i>of</i> <i>fundamental</i>
<i>identity</i> <i>into</i> <i>a</i> <i>witch</i>-<i>hunt</i> <i>for</i>
<i>the</i> <i>specific</i> <i>things</i> <i>in</i> <i>our</i> <i>life</i>
<i>that</i> <i>we</i> <i>imagine</i> <i>are</i> <i>making</i> <i>us</i>
<i>this</i> <i>dissatisfied</i> <i>with</i> <i>our</i> <i>basic</i>
<i>experience</i>. If someone has gotten to this level of practice,
no amount of tinkering with the specifics of our life will ever solve
the fundamental issue.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That doesn’t mean
that some of the dissatisfactions with specific aspects of our life
may not be valid, and in fact they often are quite valid. However,
these relative issues get mixed in with a far deeper issue, that of
who we really are and aren’t, and <i>until</i> <i>this</i> <i>progress</i>
<i>of</i> <i>insight</i> <i>has</i> <i>been</i> <i>completed</i>,
<i>this</i> <i>mixture</i> <i>tends</i> <i>to</i> <i>greatly</i>
<i>exaggerate</i> <i>our</i> <i>specific</i> <i>criticisms</i> <i>of</i>
<i>those</i> <i>things</i> <i>in</i> <i>our</i> <i>life</i> <i>that</i>
<i>could</i> <i>actually</i> <i>stand</i> <i>improvement</i> <i>and</i>
<i>work</i>. Learning this lesson can be very hard for some people,
and the dark irony is that they may wreck their relationships,
careers and finances, as well as emotional and physical health,
trying to get away from their own high level of insight into the true
nature of reality. Until they are willing to work on a more direct,
sensate level, there is no limit to the amount of angst and
negativity they can project onto their world. I have seen this play
out again and again in myself and in the lives of my dharma
companions. It can be a very ugly business.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My advice for such
situations is this: if, after careful analysis of your insight
practice leads you to the conclusion that you are in Re-observation,
resolve that you will not wreck your life through excessive
negativity! Resolve this strongly and often. Follow your heart as
best you can, but try to spare yourself and the world from as much
needless pain as is possible. Through sheer force of will, keep it
together until such time as you are willing to face your sensate
world directly and without anesthesia or armor. I have seen what
happens when people do otherwise, and have come to the conclusion
that, in general, things go badly if people do not follow this
advice, though some unexpected good can always come from such
situations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The framework of the
Three Trainings and the three types of suffering that is found within
each of their scope can be helpful here as well. Since people are
generally not used to facing fundamental crises of identity, i.e. the
basic issue in Re-observation, they are not familiar with the pain of
fundamental suffering. Being unfamiliar with the pain of fundamental
suffering, they are likely to imagine that it is actually suffering
produced by the specifics of their ordinary world. However, if you
have gotten to Re-observation, in short, if you have found these
techniques to be effective, have faith that the remaining advice may
be of value and try to fulfill this part of the experiment. That is,
if you are in Re-observation, the task that confronts you is to
dissociate the fundamental suffering you now know all too well from
the specifics of your life in an ordinary sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Following this
advice may sound dangerous, heartless or bizarre to some people. It
is a valid criticism. In an ideal world, we would not have to go
around second-guessing ourselves and the sources of our suffering in
the specific way that I advocate here. In an ideal world, we would
really have our psychological trip together, be able to stay with the
practice during these stages, and thus cross quickly through the Dark
Night and finish this practice cycle. It definitely can be done.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, we are not
always ideal practitioners, and thus the Dark Night often causes the
problems mentioned above that need to be dealt with somehow. My
solutions to what happens when we cannot or will not do insight
practices in the face of the Dark Night are also not ideal. However,
the outcomes are likely to be much healthier in the short and long
term than those that come from simply allowing unrestrained Dark
Night bleed-through. Strangely, I have come to the conclusion that
simply practicing is often much easier than trying to stop Dark Night
bleed-through if we are willing to just try it, though it can easily
seem otherwise. The old kindergarden evaluation, “Follows
instructions, plays well with others,” is still a valuable standard
in the Dark Night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Not restraining
one’s negativity and reactivity in the Dark Night is a bit like
getting stinking drunk and then driving in heavy traffic rather than
just sitting down and waiting to sober up. Not continuing to do
insight practices in this stage is like going into surgery, opening
up an incision, making some repairs, and then freaking out because
the patient now has a big, bleeding incision and running away from
the operating table, leaving them there to suffer. You could think of
many ways to make the patient happy and try them all, but until you
close up that wound they are gonna’ be pissed! Unfortunately, in
this case you are both the surgeon and the patient. Face the wound
and close it up! You obviously have the necessary skills, as you have
gotten this far. Use them. The operation is nearly over. There are
also those who try to investigate the true nature of their
psychological demons and life issues but get so fixated on using
insight to make them go away that they fail to hold these things in a
wider, more realistic and appropriate perspective. This subtle
corruption of insight practices turns them into another form of
denial rather than a path to awakening. Drawing from the agendas of
training in morality, in which there is concern for the specific
thoughts and feelings that make up our experience, they fail to make
progress in insight, whose agenda is simply to see the true nature of
all sensations as they are. Both are important, but it is a question
of timing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have come to the
conclusion that, with very rare and fleeting exceptions, 95% of the
sensations that make up our experience are really no problem at all,
even in the hard stages, but seeing this clearly is not always easy.
We tend to fixate on strong sensations when they arise, those that
are very painful or very pleasant, and in these times we can miss the
fact that most of our reality is likely made of sensations that are
no big deal, thus missing many great opportunities for easy insights.
Further, the Dark Night can bring up all sorts of unfamiliar feelings
that we rarely if ever have experienced with such clarity or
intensity. Until we get used to these feelings, they can frighten us
and make us reactive because of our unfamiliarity with them even if
they are not actually that strongly unpleasant.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I highly recommend
using physical sensations, such as those of the breath, as the
objects of inquiry during the Dark Night whenever possible, as
plunging into emotional content, even with the intention of
investigating it, can sometimes be a very hard way to go. Remember,
whether we gain insight through investigating physical or mental
objects is completely irrelevant! Insight is insight. Choose objects
for investigation by which you don’t get caught whenever possible.
The best thing about reality, particularly in the Dark Night, is that
<i>you</i> <i>only</i> <i>have</i> <i>to</i> <i>deal</i> <i>with</i>
<i>one</i> <i>little</i> <i>flickering</i> <i>sensation</i> <i>at</i>
<i>a</i> <i>time</i>. Staying on that level when doing insight
practices is an unusually good idea. Pay attention to what is right
in front of you, but keep your attention open.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">All of that scary
stuff said, there are people who breeze straight from the Arising and
Passing Away on through the whole of the Dark Night in as little as a
few easy minutes or hours and hardly notice it at all, so <i>don’t</i>
<i>let</i> <i>my</i> <i>descriptions</i> <i>of</i> <i>what</i> <i>can</i>
<i>sometimes</i> <i>happen</i> <i>script</i> <i>you</i> <i>into</i>
<i>imagining</i> <i>that</i> <i>the</i> <i>Dark</i> <i>Night</i> <i>has</i>
<i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>a</i> <i>gigantic</i> <i>problem</i>. It
absolutely doesn’t. These descriptions of what can sometimes happen
are merely there to help those who do encounter these sorts of
problems to realize that these things can happen and so be more able
to deal with them skillfully. There is no medal awarded for having a
tough time in the Dark Night or for staying in it for longer than
necessary, much to my dismay.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of the more
bizarre potholes we can fall into in the Dark Night is to become
identified and fascinated with the role of The Great Spiritual Basket
Case. “I am so spiritual that my life is a non-stop catastrophe of
uncontrollable insights, disabling and freakish raptures, and
constant emotional crises of the most profound nature. My spiritual
abilities are proven and verified by what a mess I am making of my
life. How brave I am to screw up my life in this way! Oh, what a
glorious and holy wreck I am.” Both my sympathy and intolerance for
those caught in this trap is directly related to the amount of time I
have spent in that trap being just like them. Whereas we should not
try to pretend that the Dark Night hasn’t made us a basket case if
it has done so, we should neither revel in being a basket case nor
use the Dark Night as an excuse for not being as kind and functional
as we can possibly be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One way or the
other, when we finally give up and rest in things as they are without
trying to change them or be them, i.e. are very accepting of our
actual humanity as well as clear about the Three Characteristics of
mental and physical phenomena, there arises...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5578_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_71"></a><a name="11__EQUANIMITY"></a>
11. EQUANIMITY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Finally, we really
begin to understand and surrender to the truth of things. We accept
the truth of our actual human lives as they are at a deep level. All
of the “stuff” that the Dark Night may have brought up may still
be going on, but somehow it has lost its ability to cause real
trouble. Equanimity is much more about something in the relationship
to phenomena than anything specific about the phenomena themselves.
Equanimity can have sort of a rough start, strangely enough, as well
as some mildly painful and irritating sensations, but the meditator
feels that some barrier has finally broken, a weight has lifted and
practice can continue. However, this stage can be such a relief after
Re-observation that it is very tempting to solidify it into the
fourth samatha jhana either because doing so is so nice or because of
fear of falling back to Re-observation, which can easily occur.
However, as I continue to mention, not investigating the qualities of
this stage, such as peace, ease, and a panoramic perspective, causes
failure to progress and makes falling back to Re-observation more
likely.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first vipassana
jhana is about building up the basic skills of what is a physical
sensations, what is a mental sensation, how they relate, and what the
Three Characteristics feel like in practice. The Arising and Passing
away is about seeing this very clearly and profoundly for the object
of meditation. The Dark Night is about these insights then coming
around to the background and seeing more complex emotional and
psychological constructs of mental and physical sensations as they
are. The fourth vipassana jhana, meaning this stage, is about seeing
the true nature of even more complex, inclusive, subtle and
fundamental things, like space, awareness, investigation, wonder,
expectation, anticipation, peace, ease, questioning, and those sorts
of things in ways that cut through the center and include the whole
background and foreground as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This early stage can
feel very familiar and “normal,” like we have remembered
something simple and good from our childhood. If we felt weary of the
world in the Dark Night, we may suddenly find that the world is just
fine and may even be more engaged with it and excited about it than
before. Again, these potentially radical mood swings can be very
disorienting to those with whom we have close relationships. Try to
be sensitive to this and their feelings. Confidence returns, but
whereas there may have been a Rambo-like quality to it during stage
4. The Arising and Passing Away, now there is more of the cool,
charming confidence of James Bond (sorry about the purely masculine
images here).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Somewhere in here
there can arise a tendency to see the world and those in it in very
strange and unusual ways. I will give one example from my own
experience, but realize that tremendous variation is possible here,
so don’t take this too seriously. It is meant to try to convey a
very general concept. I remember looking around me at all the people
on retreat and even all the chickens, birds and puppies in the
monastery, and seeing them all simultaneously as “little mush
demons” (little squat greenish creatures with big, sad mouths and
eyes) and fully enlightened buddhas at the same time. They were both.
In fact, we were both.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We were deluded and
small, yet transcendent and luminous. I could see in some very
strange way exactly how each of them, including me, was caught in the
world of form and confusion, trying to find happiness and yet doing
so from such a small and frightened place, and yet all of this was
vast buddha nature, all of this was the natural, luminous and
compassionate dance of God. Such strange perspectives that try to
resolve paradoxical insights do not always occur, but this is
included here in case they do and perhaps to provoke knowing laughter
from those with their own unique stories from this part of the path.
More sexual and stylized versions of these experiences can also
explain where some of the more exotic tantric teachings come from.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sometimes the early
part of stage 11 can produce a real sense of freedom in the
conventional sense, freedom from cares, worries, and even
responsibilities and social conventions. One may sometimes feel that
one is simply beyond everything, and it must be admitted that this is
a wonderful feeling. It tends to fade quickly enough on its own, but
it might be possible to get caught by it if one stopped practicing
entirely. Those who became spiritual fanatics or freaks after the A&amp;P
and during the Dark Night may now begin to act much more like their
old selves, with their spiritual path being much less of a Big Holy
Deal. About damn time...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Visions of bright
lights may arise once more, but they are really more associated with
stage 4, The Arising and Passing Away. Again, as with that earlier
stage, the meditator is able to sit for longer and longer periods of
time and begins to clearly perceive the Three Characteristics with
spaciousness and breadth. The big difference is that the A&amp;P is
more about the object of meditation and Equanimity is much more about
the whole sensate universe. There is less rapture and more equanimity
than in the stage of the Arising and Passing Away. There are rarely
if ever the spontaneous physical motions and odd breathing patterns
that come with that earlier stage. Unfortunately, just to make things
confusing, there is often a single double-dip unknowing event, with
one being halfway down the breath and the other at the end of that
breath, very soon after the shift from Re-observation to Equanimity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the early part of
this stage, reality may appear a bit “chunky” for a while, and
practice may seem quite possible but may seem to require steady but
sustainable work. If one is tired, one may begin having dropouts that
are similar to what occurred in Dissolution but more extreme. It may
be hard to read and pay attention, hard to listen to people and hear,
hard to notice where one is and what one is doing. The arising of
some sort of fear of madness and death is not uncommon at this stage,
but usually does not cause too much trouble and may even seem comical
or welcome. A related and common feeling in the early part of this
stage is the general sense that something big is about to happen,
though this feeling is also common before the A&amp;P Event. These
feelings are worthy of sensate investigation in a wide and inclusive
way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Reality can now be
perceived with great breadth, precision, and clarity, and soon with
no special effort. This is called “High Equanimity.” Vibrations
may become predominant, and reality may become nothing but
vibrations. Vibrating formless realms may even arise, with no
discernable image of the body being present at all. It may feel like
reality is trying to synchronize with itself, and that is exactly
correct. Investigate this feeling. Phenomena may even begin to lose
the sense that they are of a particular sense door, and mental and
physical phenomena may appear nearly indistinguishably as just
vibrations of suchness, sometimes referred to as “formations.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I put off writing
about formations for a long time, as they are a conceptually
difficult topic. Further, the classical definition of formations is
perhaps not so clear-cut, so I wondered about imposing my own
functional and experiential definitions on the term. However, as the
topic of formations has arisen in so many conversations recently, I
thought that it would be worth taking on despite the difficulties.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I am going to define
formations as the primary experience of insight meditation when one
is solidly in the fourth vipassana jhana, the 11th ñana, High
Equanimity, whose formal title is actually Knowledge of Equanimity
Concerning Formations. For those of you who find this circular
definition completely unhelpful, formations have the following
qualities when clearly experienced:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">–They contain all
the six sense doors in them, including thought, in a way that does
not split them up sequentially in time or positionally in space. If
you could take a 3D moving photograph that also captured smell,
taste, touch, sound, and thought, all woven into each other
seamlessly and containing a sense of flux, this would approximate the
experience of one formation. From a fourth vipassana jhana point of
view and from a very high dharma point of view, <i>formations</i> <i>are</i>
<i>always</i> <i>what</i> <i>occur</i>, and if they are not clearly
perceived then we experience reality the way we normally do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">–They contain not
only a complete set of aspects of all six sense doors within them,
but include the perception of space (volume) and even of
time/movement within them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">–When the fourth
vipassana jhana is first attained, subtle mental sensations might
again “split off” from “this side,” much as in the way of the
Knowledge of Mind and Body, but with the Three Characteristics of
phenomena and the space they are a part of being breathtakingly
clear. Until mental and physical sensations fully synchronize on
“that side,” there can be a bit of a “tri-ality,” in which
there is the sense of the observer “on this side,” and nearly the
whole of body and mind as two fluxing entities “over there.” As
mental phenomena and physical phenomena gradually integrate with the
sense of luminous space, this experientially begs the question, “What
is observing formations?” at a level that is way beyond just
talking about it. For you Khabbala correspondance fans, these
insights correspond to the the three points of Binah, the two points
of Chockmah, and finally the single point of Kether.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">–Formations are so
inclusive that they viscerally demonstrate what is pointed to by the
concept of “no-self” in a way that no other mode of experiencing
reality can. As formations become predominant, we are faced first
with the question of which side of the dualistic split we are on and
then with the question of what is watching what earlier appeared to
be both sides. Just keep investigating in a natural and
matter-of-fact way. Let this profound dance unfold. If you have
gotten to this point, you are extraordinarily close and need to do
very little but relax and be gently curious about your experience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">–When experienced
at very high levels of concentration, formations lose the sense that
they were even formed of experiences from distinguishable sense
doors. This is hard to describe, but one might try such nebulous
phrases as, “waves of suchness,” or “primal, undifferentiated
experience.” This is largely an artifact of experiencing formations
high up in the byproducts of the fourth vipassana jhana, i.e. the
first three formless realms. This aspect of how formations may be
experienced is not necessary for the discussions below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is the highly
inclusive quality of formations that is the most interesting, and
leads to the most practical application of discussing formations. It
is because they are so inclusive that they are the gateway to the
Three Doors to stage 15. Fruition (see the chapter called The Three
Doors). They reveal a way out of the paradox of duality, the
maddening sense that “this” is observing/controlling/subject
to/separated from/etc. a “that.” By containing all or nearly all
of the sensations comprising one moment in a very integrated way,
they contain the necessary clarity to see through the fundamental
illusions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of the primary
ways that the illusion of duality is maintained is that the mind
partially “blinks out” for a part of each formation, the part it
wants to section off to appear separate. In this way, there is
insufficient clarity to see the interconnectedness and true nature of
that part of reality, and a sense of a self is maintained. When the
experience of formations arises, it comes out of a level of clarity
that is so complete that this “blinking” can no longer easily
occur. Thus, when formations become the dominant experience, even for
short periods of time, very profound and liberating insight is close
at hand. That is why there are systematic practices that train us to
be very skilled in being aware of our whole mental and physical
existence. The more we practice being aware of what happens, the less
opportunities there are for blinking.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">During the first
three insight stages, we gained the ability to notice that mental and
physical sensations made up our world, how they interacted, and then
began to see the truth of them. We applied these skills to an object
(perhaps not of our choice, but an object nonetheless), and saw it as
it actually was with a high degree of clarity in the A&amp;P. By this
point, these skills in perceiving clearly have become so much of a
part of who we are that they began to apply themselves to the
background, space and everything that seemed to be a reference point
or separate, permanent self as we entered the Dark Night. However,
our objects may have been quite vague or too disconcerting to have
been perceived clearly. Finally, we get to equanimity and put it all
together: we can see the truth of our objects and of the whole
background and are OK with this, and the result is the perception of
formations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Formations contain
within them the seeming gap between this and that, as well as
sensations of effort, intimacy, resistance, acceptance, and all other
such aspects of sensations from which a sense of self is more easily
inferred. Thus, these aspects begin to be seen in their proper place,
their proper context, i.e. as an interdependent part of reality, and
not split off or a self.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, the level
of clarity out of which formations arise also allows one to see
formations from the time they arise to the time they disappear, thus
hitting directly at a sense of a self or sensate universe continuing
coherently in time. In the first part of the path the beginning of
objects was predominant. In the A&amp;P we got a great sense of the
middle of objects but missed subtle aspects of the beginning and end.
In the Dark Night the endings are about all we could really perceive
clearly. Formations once again put all of this work we have done
together in a very natural and complete way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Formations also
explain some of the odd teachings that you might hear about “stopping
thought.” There are three basic ways we might think about this
dangerous ideal. We might imagine a world in which the ordinary
aspects of our world which we call “thought” simply do not arise,
a world of experience without those aspects of manifestation. You can
get very close to this in very strong concentration states,
particularly the 8th samatha jhana. We might also think of stopping
experience entirely (as happens in Fruition), and this obviously
includes thought.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Formations point to
yet another possible interpretation of the common wish to “stop
thought,” as do very high levels of realization. The seeming
duality of mental and physical sensations is gone by the time we are
perceiving formations well. Thoughts appear as one luminous aspect of
the phenomenal world. In fact, I challenge anyone to describe the
bare experience of thinking or mental sensations in terms beyond
those of the five “physical” sense doors. Thus, in the face of
experiencing formations, it seems crude to speak in terms of thought
as separate from those of visual, tactile, auditory, gustatory, and
olfactory qualities, or even to speak in terms of these being
separate entities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When perceived
clearly, what we usually call “thoughts” are seen to be just
aspects of the manifesting sensate world that we artificially select
out and label as thought. Just as it would be odd to imagine that an
ocean with many shades of blue is really many little bits of ocean,
in times of high clarity it is obvious that there is manifesting
reality, and it is absolutely inclusive. Look at the space between
you and this book. We don’t go around selecting out little bits of
space and labeling them as separate. In the face of formations, the
same applies to experience, and experience obviously includes the
sensations we call thought.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Separating the early
stages of Equanimity from its mature stage, there tends to be a “near
miss,” moment when we get very close to the fruit of the path,
which serves to really chill one out, as it were. From this point
enlightenment is likely to be attained quickly as long as the
meditator continues to simply practice and gently fine tune their
awareness and precision, paying gentle attention to things like
thoughts of progress and satisfaction with equanimity. At some point
even this becomes boring, and a certain cool apathy and even
forgetfulness arises. Around this part of Equanimity there can arise
the feeling that we are not really there, or that somehow we are
completely out of phase with reality. Conducting our ordinary
business may be difficult in this phase if we are out in the world
rather than on the cushion, but it tends to last only tens of minutes
at most. The sense that one is practicing or trying to get anywhere
just vanishes, and yet this may hardly be noticeable at all. We sort
of come back, with luminosity again growing predominant. Then we get
lost in thoughts about something, some strangely clear reverie,
vision, object, or flight of fancy. By really buying in, we get set
up to check out. When understanding is completely in conformity with
the way things are, this is called...</p>

&nbsp;12. CONFORMITY</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is why
understanding things just as they are is so important. This stage
lasts only one moment and never arises again until one attains the
next stage of enlightenment. The same is true of the next two stages.
Stages 12-14 (Conformity, Change of Lineage, and Path) also share the
fact that they represent the three moments of the first entrance to
transcendent ultimate reality (stage 15. Fruition) through one of the
Three Doors. In subsequent attainments of Fruition at that path
(during the stage of Review), the three moments before Fruition are
not called Conformity, Change of Lineage and Path. These three stages
will get extensive treatment in the chapter on The Three Doors.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5582_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_73"></a><a name="13__CHANGE_OF_LINEAGE"></a>
13. CHANGE OF LINEAGE</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Having understood
things just as they are, this next stage, which also lasts for just a
moment, “does the damage” as a friend of mine joyfully put it. It
permanently changes the minds of the meditators in ways that I will
discuss in just a bit. They leave the ranks of the unenlightened and
join the ranks of those that are. While the social designation of
formal lineage transmission is a very useful thing to have received,
the results of this stage are in fact what that symbolic act is all
about. They have done it, and thus attain...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5584_1179888903"></a><a name="14__PATH"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_74"></a>
14. PATH</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stage also
lasts just a moment, and after the first completed progress of
insight it marks the first moment of the newly awakened being’s
awakened life. The first time around, this is called “stream entry”
or “first path” in the Theravada, the “fourth stage of the
second path” or “the first bhumi” in the Tibetan tradition, and
many names in Zen that are purposefully ambiguous. After a
subsequent, new progress of insight it marks the attainment of the
next level of awakening, and there are lots of names for those that
will be discussed shortly. It is directly followed by...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5586_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_75"></a><a name="15__FRUITION"></a>
15. FRUITION</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is the fruit of
all the meditator's hard work, the first attainment of ultimate
reality, emptiness, Nirvana, God or whatever you wish to call it. In
this non-state, there is absolutely no time, no space, no reference
point, no experience, no mind, no consciousness, no nothingness, no
somethingness, no body, no this, no that, no unity, no duality, and
no anything else. Reality stops cold and then reappears. Thus, this
is impossible to comprehend, as it goes completely and utterly beyond
the rational mind and the universe. To “external time” (if
someone were observing the meditator from the outside) this lasts
only an instant. It is like an utter discontinuity of the space-time
continuum with nothing in the unfindable gap.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The initial
aftershocks, however, can go on for days, and may be mild or
spectacular, fun or unsettling or some mixture of these. There are
times when it is fun to show off, and this is one of those times.
Aftershocks I have noticed after paths include but are not limited
to: the visceral feeling that sensory reality is so intense that the
nerves in one’s forehead and upper neck may not be able to handle
the strain, the feeling that one has become diffused into the
atmosphere without a center, purpose, function, sense of direction or
even of will, a feeling of joy and gratitude beyond what is normally
possible welling through one’s being, the sense of discovery of
that which one has most needed, the profound sense of coming home, a
quiet awe like the stillness after a great storm, and rapturous
transcendent highs that make anything that happened after the A&amp;P
seem like dry toast.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember how I said
in the section on the psychic powers that strong concentration and
intent make magickal things happen? Just after the attainment of a
path, particularly the first path, is a time when formal resolutions
have an outrageous amount of power. The Buddha said that the greatest
of all powers is to understand and then teach the dharma, meaning to
attain to full realization, however you define it, and to then help
others do the same. I had been advised to use this unique period in
my practice well, and I resolved to attain to full enlightenment for
the benefit of all beings as quickly as was reasonably possible.
Despite all the complex consequences of having done so, I do not
regret my decision in the least and highly recommend that you do the
same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On subsequent passes
through Fruition of that path the mind tends to be refreshed, bright,
quiet and clear for a while, and milder forms of the above listed
phenomena may occur. It is as though someone hit the reset button and
cleared out all the junk for a little while. There is a nice bliss
wave that tends to follow and may take a few seconds to develop. If
you have not learned the concentration states yet, doing so in the
afterglow of a Fruition can make them much easier to attain and
master.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5588_1179888903"></a><a name="16__REVIEW"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_76"></a>
16. REVIEW</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In this stage, the
meditator just keeps practicing largely as before. In this way, they
will learn to master the stages of insight, as they must pass through
them again each time they wish to re-attain Fruition. The first few
times through the cycle after the path has been obtained can
sometimes be quite intense and even very disturbing, as the mind
tends to be exceedingly powerful for a few days after a path has been
gained and yet is navigating in territory that is not yet mastered.
One is advised to be somewhat careful and perhaps very restrained in
what one says and does during the few days and perhaps weeks after
attaining a path or something that one thinks may be a path. However,
it also sometimes happens that realizations are hardly noticed at
all, or if they are noticed, there is simply the sense, “Well, I
guess that’s done.” Powerful cycles and the sense that things
have been completed are not sure signs that a progress of insight has
been completed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That said, when a
progress of insight is completed, one may notice the mind simply not
doing lots of useless things it used to do, and it may seem
impossible that it even was able to do them. However, it may take
some time to figure out what the permanent implications of the path
are and what is just a product of its lingering and transient
afterglow. It is likely to take quite a while to really integrate the
understandings that come from a path into one's way of being in the
world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Mixed in with the
sense of what is different is also a growing sense of what hasn’t
been changed at all, what aspects of reality are still basically
unenlightened and poorly perceived. After attaining the early paths,
what has remained untouched by that level of understanding is usually
fairly obvious. However, one of the difficulties with attaining
higher levels of enlightenment is that the sense of what is left to
do can become more and more vague and subtle. Again, give things
time. Be patient. It can sometimes take a while, perhaps weeks,
months or even years, to clearly see which understandings hold up
under the pressures of the world and which fade. You might not get a
clear sense of the limits of this path until you are well on your way
to the next one. 3 Speaking of the world, Review is a great time to
re-engage with the specifics of our life. It is an unfortunate but
true fact that one of the possible side effects of the relentless
focus on the Three Characteristics that produces these spectacular
insights is the habit of not paying much attention to the specifics
of our life. The specifics of our life are obviously very, very
important, and so now is a great time to pay a lot of attention to
them. Those around us may have noticed the side effects of the Dark
Night or some of the other stages and be worried about us or even mad
at us for how we behaved if we allowed too much to bleed through. It
is not always possible to make up for that sort of damage, but now is
a good time to try. Take the time to heal the old wounds you
discovered in yourself or created in your life while you were in the
Dark Night.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, go out and
have some fun! Enjoy the richness of friendship, exercise, leisure,
work, entertainment, service, and life in general. In short, do your
best to make your life a great one in the conventional sense. You
should have been trying to do that all along, but try to forgive
yourself and learn from your mistakes if you were not able to do so.
Remember, the kind of renunciation that brings insights is seeing the
true nature of things. <i>If</i> <i>you</i> <i>can</i> <i>see</i> <i>the</i>
<i>true</i> <i>nature</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>sensations</i> <i>that</i>
<i>make</i> <i>up</i> <i>a</i> <i>fun</i> <i>and</i> <i>healthy</i>
<i>life</i>, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> <i>no</i> <i>need</i> <i>for</i>
<i>any</i> <i>other</i> <i>type</i> <i>of</i> <i>renunciation</i>! In
fact, buying into a strong renunciation trip is well known for making
people quite neurotic, and then the challenge is to see the true
nature of the sensations that make up renunciation-induced neuroses.
I’m not convinced that this is an easier way to go.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">After attaining a
path, particularly the early ones, the feeling that one is
particularly special is common, and from a certain point of view it
is true and understandable. However, what is truer is that something
in the understanding of the relationship to ordinary things is now
“special,” or at least somewhat unusual. The attainment of stream
entry or a new stage of awakening should be a cause for joy and
celebration. Unfortunately, people who have never attained these
things tend to react oddly or even poorly to such disclosures and
sentiments. Strangely, many people are very excited about the idea of
people getting enlightened but not the idea of <i>you</i> getting
enlightened. Those with higher levels of understanding than yours
will know where you are coming from, but will also know how much more
there is to go from their own experience, and their tendency to focus
on that can be frustrating. One’s teachers and more advanced
companions may find it amusing to be reminded of what it was like to
be caught up in the fascination with low levels of realization, but
they know that eventually even that has to be seen in some other way.
One of my favorite Chogyam Trungpa lines is, “You will never be
decorated by your guru.” Even if you are, I doubt if it will be of
any great benefit to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, two ironies of
the spiritual life that one can encounter here are that success can
cause feelings of isolation and that the spiritual path can be a very
lonely one indeed. Sometimes writing can help, as can finding those
few people who seem to simultaneously be interested in hearing the
details of what you are going through without reinforcing your
fascination with these in ways that make it harder to see successes
in their proper proportion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is also not
uncommon to feel that what one has experienced is just so
staggeringly profound that no one is likely to have ever really seen
such amazing things, perhaps including one’s teachers. However, if
they are the real deal and qualified to teach you, they are very
likely to have their own extensive list of spectacular and profound
experiences and realizations. However, as such things are so rarely
discussed openly, one may have a hard time believing this. As I have
had to learn the hard way, those who are particularly prone to
extroversion and immoderate speech in the face of recent insights can
easily get themselves into somewhat embarrassing and humbling
situations. On the other hand, eventually you may begin to outgrow or
surpass your current teachers in understanding and ability. This in
and of itself can be confusing and frustrating, causing role
reversals that not everyone handles well. You might be astounded at
how easy it is to bruise the egos in the conventional psychological
sense of those who have seen through the illusion of the ego in the
high dharma sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As review continues,
one gets very familiar with the territory of one’s current path and
its stages, and they may pass by more and more quickly and easily. It
can begin to seem that the only way to move through the Review stages
of insight is to not investigate reality too closely. At some point,
Fruition will no longer be as attractive and one will feel that one
really could be practicing more clearly and precisely. This is a
strong sign that the next set of stages is ready to arise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That said, there may
be times when one simply doesn’t want to make progress as one can’t
afford to be risking another Dark Night at that point in their life.
Strong resolutions to stay in Review, a lack of really precise
investigation and lots of indulgence in concentration states can help
one stay in a Review phase until one is ready to move onward.
However, progress of some kind can only be postponed for so long, and
the dharma has a relentless way of pushing us onward.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5590_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_77"></a><a name="25__THE_VIPASSANA_JHANAS"></a>
25. THE VIPASSANA JHANAS</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The vipassana jhanas
are a way of describing the stages of insight that is a bit more
broad than the map that breaks the stages down into 16 ñanas. They
are two descriptions of the same territory, and both have their uses.
The vipassana jhanas differ from the concentration jhanas (samatha
jhanas) in that they include the perception of the Three
Characteristics, rather than the “pure” samatha jhanas that
require ignoring the Three Characteristics to get them to appear
stable and clean. However, the two may share many qualities,
including very similar widths of attention and other aspects. There
are eight vipassana jhanas, the first four that are formed, and the
last four that are formless, with the odd exception of the fact that
the eighth vipassana jhana (Neither Perception Nor Yet
Non-Perception) cannot be easily investigated, as it is generally too
subtle to clearly reveal the Three Characteristics. Thus, calling it
a vipassana jhana is a bit problematic. However, it is part of the
standard pattern of progress, so is worthy of inclusion, and helps
explain some of the material found in the old texts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember how I
mentioned in the chapter called Concentration vs. Insight that the
original texts used the same four or eight jhanas to delineate the
states of concentration and the stages of insight? Remember how I
said that the delineation of the stages of insight didn't occur until
the later commentaries? In the second half of the 20th Century,
considerable work was done to try to resolve these maps. As with most
terminological issues in the spiritual life, there is some
disagreement about just how the jhanas and the stages of insight line
up, and I will touch on these in this chapter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The practical
application of delineating the vipassana jhanas is that the traps
that awaited us in the samatha jhanas can arise during the progress
of insight, and so being able to apply the body of advice that deals
with these occurrences can be very helpful. For instance, we may be
going along in the progress of insight but get stuck when we stop
investigating rapture, which is a part of the early jhanas and also
of some of the early insight stages. Thus, realizing that there are
some relationships between the samatha and vipassana jhanas can keep
us on the lookout for aspects of our experience that we may be
missing or artificially solidifying, as it is so tempting to do so.
Going the other way, if we have some mastery of a set of insight
stages, we can use these stages to learn get into samatha jhanas by
concentrating on solidifying their predominant positive qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are also those
who say that the jhanas and stages of insight do not line up at all,
but this is too doctrinal, not in accord with what one experiences on
the cushion (or in some other posture), and doesn't help resolve the
problems created in the original texts of the Pali Canon. For those
who are still die hard traditionalists and believe that the jhana
terminology only applies to pure concentration practices, I offer the
following quote from the Buddha that is found in my favorite sutta,
#111, One by One as They Occurred, in <u>The</u> <u>Middle</u>
<u>Length</u>&nbsp; <u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Buddha</u>,
as translated by Bhikkhu Ñanamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“And the states in
the first jhana – the applied thought, the sustained thought, the
rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of mind; the contact,
feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy,
mindfulness, equanimity and attention – these states were defined
by him one by one as they occurred; known to him they arose, known to
him they were present, known to him they disappeared. He understood
thus: ‘So indeed, these states, not having been, come into being;
having been, they vanish.’”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Those with
traditional views can squirm and pontificate any way they like, but
this guy is clearly maintaining an extremely fast, consistent and
precise investigation of impermanence and is thus clearly doing
insight practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To digress for just
a moment into another rant, the guy the Buddha is talking about here
is none other than my hero, Sariputta, who incidentally is often the
whipping boy of much ridiculous and degrading Mahayana propaganda.
Don’t get me wrong, the Mahayana has done some great things in its
day, but ragging on someone with this level of skill and insight is
just hypocritical and arrogant beyond reason. The Buddha says that
Sariputta goes on to do very precise and powerful insight practices
high up into the formless realms and attains to very liberating
insights. I often hear Nouveau Tibetan Buddhists making comments that
clearly indicate that they feel themselves to be quite qualified to
denigrate his practice and don’t seem to notice how ironic this is,
as they are almost always those whose own spiritual progress doesn’t
qualify them to lick the muddy sandals of someone with a fraction of
Sariputta’s talents. When one in a thousand of the meditators I
meet who make these absurd and insulting statements about Sariputta
can do what he could do or understand what he understood, I’ll eat
this book. You have no idea how good it feels to write paragraphs
like this one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Back to business.
All of this map stuff is only helpful if it keeps <i>you</i>
practicing clearly and in a way that brings results. I will discuss
more of the pros and cons of maps soon enough.</p>

BILL HAMILTON’S MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The vipassana jhana
model I like the most because it is the one that most clearly fits
with my extensive investigation of the vipassana jhanas is the one
that was used by the late, great Bill Hamilton. He was also quite a
mighty meditator in his own right, if a highly under-appreciated one.
True, he was a quirky old bat on a good day, but he also died an
arahat and a mighty scholar who had complete mastery of the formless
realms. There was nothing particularly spectacular about Bill’s
life other than his understanding of it, and he died in poverty and
obscurity in basic denial of the severity of his pancreatic cancer. I
have never met anyone who had given the question of the vipassana
jhanas more consideration, and his fascination with complex models
was remarkable. A quick digression here about Bill, as I did dedicate
this book to his memory...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Bill Hamilton was
not only a meditation master, he was also a rogue teacher and
basically felt like an outcast from the modern international
Vipassana community. The guy was basically too smart, too
uncompromising, too scholarly, and too dedicated to non-watered-down
dharma and to absolute mastery to be a popular mainstream teacher. He
didn’t teach to make people feel good about themselves, with
friends, or attain to power, fame or money.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">His obscurity was a
tragic loss for the many people who didn't know about him. However,
for me and a few others who knew about him and were willing to put up
with the fact that he was basically a strange, suspicious, perhaps
paranoid, and fairly quirky dude, Bill Hamilton was just what we were
looking for. Bill seemed to live for the sole purpose of sharing his
dharma rather than for flying around the world, making money, or
being popular. Unlike the few other Western dharma teachers with his
level of mastery, you could call Bill on the phone and talk for hours
about this stuff, and then you could do it again. His very
unpopularity made him a true and accessible teacher. The other nice
things about Bill were that he would talk about actual mastery
(though you had to drag it out of him) and also had incredibly high
standards that I found quite refreshing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Bill also taught in
a very interesting way. His style was basically to seem extremely
skeptical that any of your descriptions of any experiences could
really have anything to do with the attainment of anything. This was
basically quite irritating, but it made his students question deeply
whether or not they were really experiencing what they thought they
were and so look more deeply at the truth of each moment. It also
served as a helpful counterbalance to his interest in models and
specifically named levels of attainment. His teaching style didn't
win him many friends, but it was powerful and served his ends. Part
of my fantasy is that a bit of his edge, uncompromising attitude and
deep understanding may have come through in this work, though it must
be stated explicitly that Bill never let on that he was particularly
impressed with anything I ever described in my own practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Back to discussing
Bill's Vipassana Jhana model. The table below explains which ñanas
fall into which jhanas, and is a re-arrangement of the table in the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, when in each
of those ñanas, one can learn something from its jhana aspect, and
when in each of the jhanas one can notice what insight territory is
available there. Further, as the division between samatha and
vipassana is actually not nearly so straightforward as some would
make it out to be, there can be a lot of natural movement back and
forth that can occur between vipassana jhanas and samatha jhanas even
when trying to keep to just one side. As the Three Characteristics
are always presenting themselves, even in seemingly created,
blissful, stable samatha territory, those with strong mindfulness and
concentration may have to work to avoid perceiving them. Also, those
doing strong insight practice may again and again chance into
territory that has a more samatha feel, and if they are expecting
things to be purely by the ñana descriptions they may get lost or
confused by this. Lastly, those who have attained at least stream
entry are constantly cycling through the ñanas from the 4th to the
11th and then to Fruition, so even if they try to do pure samatha
practice, the pull towards each next ñana/vipassana jhana is strong,
and they basically are always from then on doing some fusion of the
two even when they try to keep things purely on the samatha side.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will illustrate
the vipassana jhanas with a description of some candle-flame
meditation I did when on retreat and playing around with the samatha
jhanas by using kasinas. Kasinas are various traditional practices
that involve using physical objects such as colored disks, candles,
etc. as a starting point to attain samatha jhanas, powers and the
like. They are described in the standard references I list in the
chapter on the the Concentration States.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The retreat when I
first really nailed down the details of the vipassana jhanas was a 17
day retreat that I went on when I was an anagami (the third stage of
awakening in one of the models of awakening, to be discussed
shortly). I didn't begin playing with this territory until around the
second week of the retreat, and by that point my concentration was
very strong and flexible. It didn't take me more than a day before I
could go through the following cycle. Initially, I would stare at a
candle flame until I really could stay with it, then there would be a
natural shift, I would close my eyes, and I would see the visual
purple phenomena where the afterimage of the flame was burned onto my
retina.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This would fade in a
few seconds to be replaced by a red dot in the center of my visual
field. The red dot was clear, very round, pure, bright and seemingly
stable. However, within a minute or so it would begin to shake, roll
off to one side, and I would notice all sorts of things about how
intention and observation messed with the position, stability, and
clarity of the dot. First seeing the dot is the first samatha jhana,
and in this case is the equivalent of Mind and Body, where mental
phenomena become clear external objects. Noticing things about
intention influencing the position and stability of the dot is cause
and effect.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Shortly thereafter
this would become irritating and the dot would begin to shake,
shudder, split up, spin off to one side or the other, and generally
seem to misbehave quite on its own. This was the entrance to the
Three Characteristics. After a while of this, practice would shift,
become naturally stronger, and this slightly larger red dot would
appear in the center again that stayed there on largely its own, but
it had a gold spinning star in its center that would spin on its own
with a speed and direction that varied with the phase of the breath,
which I noticed when I would break my focus enough to notice that.
This addition of motion, the image happening on its own, and somewhat
wider attention (wider dot), not to mention bliss when I broke my
concentration a bit and focused on my body, is the entrance to the
second vipassana jhana.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The red dot with the
spinning gold star would gradually acquire purple, green and blue
rings around its outside, and then there would be a sudden shift
where the red dot would vanish and be replaced by a slightly larger
black dot. The black dot initially would seem to be a good focus, but
quickly the area around the black dot got more interesting, with many
very complex multi-point stars all circling slowly around it, getting
wider and wider, with the interference patterns between them getting
more and more complex, while the black dot faded somewhat, but to
what was unclear. This addition of a problem perceiving the center
but with complex patterns of experience with multiple frequencies
going out to the periphery marks the early and middle phases of the
third vipassana jhana. Further, as the thing got wider, there was
this slightly disconcerting feeling that attention was out of phase
with the visuals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As the complex
patterns around the outside began to become more spherical as the
edges wrapped around towards me, they began to be made out of lines
that had more of a rainbow quality to them, with many complex motions
and many-fold symmetry. This was harder to pay attention to and
simultaneously comprehend it all, marking the mature third vipassana
jhana and the later stages of the Dark Night. Note, as this is being
done with almost no fixation on psychological content and with very
strong concentration, I did not have any of the typical feelings that
sometimes accompany this territory when it cycles through with less
concentration. Instead, it stayed at the level of geometry, image and
light except when I widened my attention somewhat to notice other
aspects.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This complex sphere
on which was unfolding more and more complex patterns would then
shift to something far more inclusive of space and the center of
attention, thus becoming much more three dimensional. At this point,
things seemed to happen on their own, but in a silent, clear, all
encompassing way that was way beyond the second jhana, and this marks
the entrance to the fourth vipassana jhana.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As things would
organize, there would arise all sorts of images, from Buddhas to
black holes, from brilliantly formed Tantric images (Vajrasattva with
consort, etc.) to complex abstract, three dimensional designs that
included the whole field of attention, with all made of rainbow
lines, luminous, living, and very clear. I could end the cycle with
essentially any image I wished with an ease I had never previously
achieved. If I had not previously determined an image to end with,
the surprises were just as good as anything I came up with and
sometimes better. The point is that if you get your concentration
strong enough, you can do these things also.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Shortly after the
clear image would arise, attention would shift to include the
fundamental characteristics of the whole thing at level that was
perfectly inclusive of what ordinarily would be called subject and
object, and Fruition would arise as the whole thing vanished through
one of the Three Doors, but with a clarity that is rare. Then I would
open my eyes, stare at the flame, and do it all again. Each cycle
took about 10-15 minutes, but I could linger in each stage for longer
if I consciously resisted the pull to move onward.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While obviously this
example involves very clean samatha-like images, very strong
concentration, and was done by an advanced practitioner under
relatively special conditions, this candle flame technique can be
very interesting, and in classes I have taught some were able to
quickly get to the later jhanas without too much time or effort. Some
people just seem to have a natural ability to visualize, or focus on
a mantra, or some other object, and it makes a lot of sense of draw
on these natural tendencies. It can also be fun to develop these
fronts even if this is not your strong suit, as it helps expand the
range of your practice. Thus, consider playing around with using
other objects and focuses at times, as they can bring different
perspectives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To give another
example, using a different object, if one is using a mantra, one may
notice that at some point one shifts to being able to stay with
mantra clearly and perceive it as an object, which is the first
jhana, starting with Mind and Body. Once the mantra is clear, one may
notice all sorts of things about the process of mentally creating the
mantra, such as the stream of intentions being followed shortly
behind by the string of the mantra itself follow slightly behind by
the mental echo of the perception of the mantra, making what appear
to be three separate streams of the mantra. This is direct insight
into Cause and Effect, and as the Three Characteristics of each of
these streams become clear, the first jhana matures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then the mantra will
shift to presenting itself, and will become very clear, as if it is
reciting itself. This is obviously the second jhana, and one may
experience A&amp;P-like phenomena around here. As the practitioner
shifts into the third jhana, the mantra gets wide in the stereo
field, complex, with interesting harmonies if one is so inclined, and
yet it may seem to be out of phase with attention or it may seem
distorted, annoying, like something that was once beautiful has
become noisy. One may experience Dark Night-related phenomena in this
phase. As the shift to the fourth jhana comes, the mantra may become
part of a very wide, more quite background, as attention becomes
inclusive. Other fourth jhana-like or high equanimity-like phenomena
may occur around here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, the vipassana
jhana model can really help people line up experiences across
objects, traditions, and practitioners, as they get to the common
ground of spiritual terrain in a more fundamental way than the ñanas
may, as those with strong concentration abilities may dodge a lot of
the emotional side effects that are emphasized by that map, and those
using different objects may have such seemingly different pathways.
However, now that you know the vipassana jhanas, if you practice well
or ask good questions of those you speak with, you should have a much
easier time of lining things up and making sense of things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing that
can help is noticing that each jhana has its smaller aspects that can
be classified in a manner different from the ñanas, and here I refer
to what Bill labeled the sub-jhanas. As I mentioned on the section on
the samatha jhanas, each jhana, vipassana or otherwise, has its
sub-phases. Initially, the jhana is new, fresh, clear, but perhaps a
bit unsteady as the mind gets used to it (first sub-jhana), then it
really comes into its own (second sub-jhana), then the flaws and
limits of the jhana are perceived (third sub-jhana), then there is
some sort of balanced synthesis of these that at once allows the flaw
and begins to incorporate the pull towards that which comes next
(fourth sub-jhana).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In this way, it is
possible to see models within models within models, and if you
practice long and clearly enough with the models in mind you will run
into this aspect of things. The warnings about the problems with the
models go ten times or more for the sub-jhana models and deeper
fractal theories of meditation terrain. They are a largely endless
subject whose usefulness is debatable and whose perils are well
known. Consider yourself duly warned!</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5594_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_79"></a><a name="FRACTALS"></a>
FRACTALS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Unfortunately, I
somehow am not able to keep myself from presenting just a few of the
basics of fractal theory here, particularly as it relates to Bill’s
model. There is also something exceedingly universal about the
pattern that I am about to present, and resonances of it are found
back as far as there is recorded human history, religion and art.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you consider the
first 360 degrees of a sine wave (like a rounded capital italic “<i>N</i>”
that has been tilted just a bit to the right), you will notice that
is starts at zero, goes up in a hill-like way, peaks, descends below
where it started in a valley-like way, bottoms out, and then returns
to the same level at which it began but yet farther along.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Were one walking on
this curve, one would have to make effort to climb up the hill. One
would then have a spectacular view and a great sense of
accomplishment. One might then try to keep walking up to get more of
this, but end up sliding down the other side of the hill, farther 5
down in fact than where one began. And yet, this is still progress,
and could even be somewhat thrilling and even effortless with the
right attitude. Just when one gets to the very bottom, trapped in the
darkest part of the pit, by finally coming to rest at the absolute
bottom the upward motion begins to happen naturally, and one returns
to where one was, ground zero, and yet farther on at the same time. A
cycle is complete and yet begins again endlessly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This easily
correlates with the first four vipassana jhanas, as well as many
other obvious cycles such as those of the sun and seasons, etc. For
those trying to correlate the maps of the progress of insight with
those of Tantra’s Five Buddha Families or those of any number of
pagan and nature-based traditions, this should prove most helpful.
The first vipassana jhana is climbing up the hill, eager beginnings,
hard work, dawn, Spring, East, etc. The second vipassana jhana is the
giddy high of accomplishment at the top of the hill, high noon,
Summer, South, etc. The third vipassana jhana is the exhilarating and
yet scary fall far down the other side into a cool and shadowy
valley, dusk and nightfall, Autumn, West, etc. The fourth vipassana
jhana is coming to rest regardless of where one is and returning to
one’s origin naturally, the cool of the dead of night and early
morning, Winter and the promise of Springtime, the coming of a new
year at the end of the old, a time of rest, completion and renewal,
North. The correlations with the stages of insight are thus obvious.
One may also correlate this with some of the models of awakening,
particularly the Four Path Model and the Simple Model of awakening,
both of which will be explained later.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Interestingly, one
may begin to see a full cycle of each of these stages in each of the
four vipassana jhanas as well, with each peak and valley adding or
subtracting from the position of the greater wave it is an aspect of.
For all you incurable model geeks, try plotting y=sin(x)+0.25*sin(4x)
from x=0 to 2π on a graphing program. You have my sympathy. The
x-axis is the jhanas and sub-jhanas, from 1.1 to 4.4, or 1.1.1 to
4.4.4 if you want to go into sub-sub-jhanas. Unfortunately, what goes
on the y-axis would be the subject of a book longer than this one and
would read like the most difficult works of Aleister Crowley. In
short, the possible complexity of this model is endless and it is no
substitute for practice. Try not to become an arrogant twit like I
did when I began to figure all this stuff out. Esoteric map theory
won’t win you any friends.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have spent way too
much time thinking about the fractals and modeling in my own
practice. In my insecure moments, I have considered showing off and
writing a book that detailed the hundreds of little parallels and
patterns that I have noticed over the years, how this tiny little
stage of some vipassana sub-jhana mirrored or was in inversion of
another aspect of some other little stage of some other
sub-sub-jhana, but I couldn’t come up with any practical use for it
at all. If you do the technique, you will see all of this and more.
If not, reading about it won’t help you. It’s just another
content trap, but a seductive one for us pseudo-intellectuals. On the
other hand, Khabbala seems to have made related permutations into
meditation itself, and those who are particularly inclined to this
sort of analysis might want to try taking it as a vehicle for going
beyond it. Also, guess where the complex geometric Tibetan Mandalas
that are supposed to be pictures of the Mind or the Universe come
from? Bingo!</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5596_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_80"></a><a name="U_PANDITA_S_MODEL"></a>
U PANDITA’S MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">U Pandita, one of
the greatest modern masters of meditation in the Burmese Theravada
tradition (see his work <u>In</u> <u>This</u> <u>Very</u> <u>Life</u>)
doesn't quite agree with Bill and I about how the ñanas and jhana
line up, and so I thought that in the interest of fairness I would
present his model . In his model, as in Bill's model, the first three
stages of Mind and Body, Cause and Effect, and The Three
Characteristics all fall within the first vipassana jhana. However,
he divides the Arising and Passing Away into two jhanas, with the
immature phase (when the meditator is still in the grip of the Ten
Corruptions of Insight) corresponding to the second jhana and the
mature phase (when the meditator sees the true nature of the Ten
Corruptions of Insight and crosses the A&amp;P Event) as the third
jhana. Everything from Dissolution to Equanimity then falls into the
fourth jhana in his model. This does accommodate the vague formless
experiences that can happen in Dissolution, as the formless realms
come out of the fourth jhana.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The problem with
this map is similar to the problem with the other maps, namely that
some of the stages of insight tend to suck and the samatha or pure
concentration jhanas are always a good time or 7 peaceful. Thus, to
say that the Dark Night stages such as Disgust are part of the fourth
jhana just rubs the wrong way somehow, as does saying that Three
Characteristics (which also tends to suck a bit) is part of the
enjoyable first jhana. The point is that no matter how you slice it,
the correlations are not quite perfect, and insight practice is
rarely as pleasant as good old concentration practices. That said,
there is something to these models anyway, and if you master insight
and concentration practices and know a bit of theory, you will see
for yourself what they were trying to get at, so get to it!</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5598_1179888903"></a><a name="INKLINGS_OF_ONE_MORE_MODEL"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_81"></a>
INKLINGS OF ONE MORE MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The last model is
one that is hinted at by the a line in <u>The</u>&nbsp; <u>Visuddhimagga</u>
when it says that Desire for Deliverance, Re-observation and
Equanimity are one. This cryptic phrase may mean many things. One of
them is that the content of these three stages is likely to be
largely the same, while the relationship to it may change
dramatically. It could also be used as justification for a third
model that put these three together in the fourth jhana. Further, as
the fourth vipassana jhana is about equanimity concerning formations,
one might presume that one would have had to perceive formations at
an earlier stage, such as the previous two, in order to have had the
necessary time and experience to come to equanimity concerning them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Go see for yourself
and consider which of these three models presented here fits with
your actual experience, or throw this book and all of its models out
the window and investigate the Three Characteristics precisely
regardless of what happens! Actually, such decisions might be better
made after reading the next chapter...</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5600_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_82"></a><a name="26__HOW_THE_MAPS_HELP"></a>
26. HOW THE MAPS HELP</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now that I have
presented the maps of the Progress of Insight, I will reiterate just
a bit about how they help and why I went to all of that trouble. I
will try to do this in chronological sequence and tie it in with what
has been said in Part I.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The maps tell you
clearly what you are looking for and explain exactly and precisely
why you are looking for it, how that insight helps, and how that
insight provides the ground for what follows. The same thing could be
said of the concentration state maps. If the stages of insight didn’t
tend to bring up all sorts of unusual raptures and produce such a
wide range of potentially destabilizing emotional side effects, there
would not be so much need for the maps. You could simply tell people
to increase their perceptual abilities until they got enlightened,
and they would likely have few difficulties in doing so by properly
applying the techniques. However, the insight stages do tend to cause
these sorts of effects, so the maps are very useful for keeping
people on track in the face of them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember long ago in
the chapter called The Seven Factors of Enlightenment when I
mentioned that the first factor was mindfulness and that this was
really good for sorting out what is mind and what is body and when
each is and isn't there? That is because the first insight you are
looking for, the one that gets you in a position to see more deeply,
is stage 1. Mind and Body. Get it? This stuff is not random or
arbitrary. It is all clearly laid out in a way that helps and fits
with reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember how I said
in that chapter that one should try to experience the intentions that
precede actions and thoughts, as well as the mental impression or
“consciousness” that follows all sensations? That is the
understanding in stage 2. Cause and Effect. Thus, mindfulness is the
first factor of enlightenment because it leads directly to the first
two classic insights into the truth of what is actually going on. If
you want insight into something, then looking into that aspect of
things precisely is the best way to acquire that insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Once one has
directly experienced these two insights, then the Three
Characteristics begin to become obvious in stage 3. The Three
Characteristics, which is exactly why the next factor of
enlightenment is called investigation of the truth, i.e. the Three
Characteristics. Both the Seven Factors of Enlightenment and the
insight maps tell you exactly what you are trying to understand and
why. Their order is not arbitrary in the least.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You will not be able
to understand the Three Characteristics directly without sorting out
what is mind and what is body and the relationships between them.
Without understanding the Three Characteristics, regardless of what
you call them, you will not be able to go further and will not be
able to get enlightened. The Buddha laid it all out step by step.
While this may seem unromantic and perhaps even dry, it is also
exceedingly practical and without a doubt the clearest presentation
of exactly how to wake up that I have ever seen presented in any
spiritual system, just so my biases are made perfectly clear. In
short, these maps and techniques can be <i>profoundly</i> <i>empowering</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Once the Three
Characteristics begin to become clear, the mind naturally speeds up
and becomes more powerful. This is because it finally begins to draw
on its tremendous power to see things directly without processing
them through thought. Anyone who has driven a car, played a video
game or done just about anything else for that matter knows that you
just have to do it, but if you tried to think about every little
thing you were doing it would be impossible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This increase in
mental power due to non-conceptual and direct experience is related
to the third factor of enlightenment, energy. Energy may now even be
blazing up and down one's spinal cord, the mind gets bright and
alert, and soon energy is flowing naturally, as one begins to enter
the early part of stage 4. The Arising and Passing Away. Remember how
this correlates with the second samatha jhana, where applied and
sustained attention or effort are no longer needed? They just happen
on their own to a large extent, and energy is naturally present.
Thus, it all ties together.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The next factor of
enlightenment is rapture, which comes to predominate in the second
vipassana jhana and the Arising and Passing Away just as it does in
the second samatha jhana. Thus, all of the important advice about
rapture given earlier applies to the insight maps in Part III. One is
generally advised to avoid becoming a rapture or Kundalini-junkie in
that stage, although I suppose if that is your primary reason for
meditating, it is certainly your right to do so. Just be wary of the
inevitable crash.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">During the mature
Arising and Passing Away, as well as in Dissolution, tranquility
becomes important and more pronounced, but then becomes too strong in
late Dissolution. Thus, it becomes important to build the sixth
factor of enlightenment, concentration.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Finally, when the
Dark Night really kicks in, as it will once one can again find one's
objects and stay with them (Fear through Re-observation), then
Equanimity in the face of all experience becomes vital for progress,
as stated in Part I. Thus, Equanimity can arise and that Path can be
attained.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As mentioned before,
the maps fill in the seemingly huge, frustrating and nebulous gap
from doing something like sitting on a cushion paying attention to
the sensations of your breath and finally getting enlightened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The maps also tell
you exactly what the common errors of each stage are. They warn
people about not getting stuck in 1. Mind and Body by solidifying it
into a jhanic state, which it closely resembles. They provide comfort
and explanation when things might get jerky, unpleasant or even
downright painful in the stage 3. Three Characteristics. They
admonish people not to get too fascinated with how much of a mighty
meditator they might feel like in the stage of the 4. Arising and
Passing Away, and to even examine the sensations that make up the
seemingly wondrous and tantalizing corruptions of insight such as
equanimity and rapture. They warn of the possibility of thinking that
one is enlightened when going though that stage, as well as saying
that it is normal for wild and sometimes explosive experiences to
occur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I spoke with a
friend who basically wanted me to help him rationalize that his
recent A&amp;P experiences occasionally allowed him to touch High
Equanimity. My advice was that a much more helpful form of inquiry
would be to notice the sensations of fascination with this issue and
the sensations of the rest of his sensate universe come and go moment
to moment. If he couldn’t manage this, he should be putting his
time into trying to figure out how to get together enough vacation
time and money to do another long retreat and/or how to increase his
daily practice time and the thoroughness of his investigation. The
maps clearly state that the process is not a particularly linear one,
and that after the highs of the Arising and Passing Away there
usually follows times of difficulty when all of the spectacular power
of the mind and the enjoyment of meditation gained in the Arising and
Passing Away is likely to fade dramatically. They warn of the
numerous difficulties that may or may not be faced in the Dark Night,
as well as provide lots of information about how to deal with them.
The most common mistake is failing to investigate the truth of
sensations deemed undesirable. It is hard to get on more intimate
terms with reality when we feel a bit too emotional, vulnerable,
openhearted or shaken, and so progress in the Dark Night is not
always easy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While I do generally
wish to avoid biting the hands that have fed me, I must say that not
telling students about this territory from the beginning so as to
give them a heads up to what might happen is so extremely
irresponsible and negligent that I just want to spit and scream at
those who perpetuate this warped culture of secrecy. While many
teachers may not do so because they don’t think many people will
ever get this far, that in and of itself is a scary assumption that
should cause some serious questioning of their teaching methods,
techniques, and perhaps even motivations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Imagine that there
is a meditation medication called Damnitall that is used to treat
some form of suffering (perhaps it’s a pain medicine or an
anti-depressant). However, in a subset of patients its long-term use
is known to cause pronounced of anxiety, paranoia, depression,
apathy, micro-psychotic episodes, a pervasive sense of primal
frustration, pronounced lack of perspective on relationships, reduced
libido, feelings of dissatisfaction with worldly affairs, and
exacerbation of personality disorders, all of which can lead to
markedly reduced social and occupational function. Imagine that these
side effects are known to persist sometimes months and even years
after someone stops taking the medication, with occasional flare-ups
and relapses, with the only permanently effective treatment being to
increase the dose, along with supportive care and counseling, and
hope that these side effects pass quickly with little damage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, imagine that
you are living in the dark days of paternalistic medicine during
which doctors are prescribing this stuff without fully disclosing the
potential side effects despite the fact that they are fully aware of
them. Imagine that drug companies are not forced to disclose known
side effects. Does anything in this scenario make you a bit
uncomfortable? I should hope so!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let’s say for the
sake of argument that I am a fanatic who is blowing this thing way
out of proportion. Let’s assume that Damnitall only causes these
effects in 1 out of every 10,000 patients. Would you have these side
effects included on the little piece of paper that comes in the
bottle? Lets say it’s 1 in a 100? At what point does it become
absurd that those doctors and drug companies are being allowed to get
away with this? Unfortunately, I must admit that I do not know the
exact odds of these side effects happening to you. I do know
firsthand that they happen and that if you cross the A&amp;P Event
you are fairly likely to run into at least some of them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These side effects
are no fantasy. When they show up they are as real and powerful as if
some dangerous drug had seriously skewed your neurochemistry, and I
often wonder if that might be something like what happens. Thus, it
seems only fair to have the same standards that we apply with such
pronounced zeal and fervent litigation to drug companies and doctors
also apply to meditation teachers and dharma books. For reasons
unknown to me, this book is the first one I know of to spell out all
of these things explicitly in language that everyone should be able
to understand so that you can go into meditation having been fully
informed of the risks and benefits and thus make informed decisions
about your own practice. In the spirit of professionalism, I call on
others who promote the dharma to adopt a similarly high standard for
their own work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Maps point out that
people might be able to get stuck for a little while in Equanimity if
they do not investigate the sensations that make up even equanimity,
peace, relief, expectation, confidence, etc. The models also go into
great detail about what actually happens in each stage of
enlightenment and what does not happen (presented later), though this
aspect of the maps is much more controversial than the maps of the
progress of insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, the maps at
their best tell the meditator in clear and systematic ways exactly
what to do, what to look for, why, and exactly how not to screw up at
each stage. They are no substitute for clear practice and
investigation of the sensations that make up one’s experience, and
they are poor aids to those who refuse to heed them and follow their
advice. As I continue to mention, they can also be used as a basis
for useless and even harmful competition between gung ho meditators
with insecurity issues. It can and has been argued convincingly that
one certainly doesn’t need to know these maps at all so long as one
practices well. Despite the dangers of competition and
over-intellectualization, the maps still have tremendous value when
used as they were meant to be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One very valid
criticism of the maps, as I mentioned before, is that people are
often very susceptible to suggestion, often called “scripting.”
Describing these stages can cause people to have something that
resembles these experiences just because they have been told that
they are expected. The part of the maps that deals with emotional
side effects is notorious for causing this particular kind of
mimicry. For example, it is basically impossible to sort out what is
just fear and what is insight stage 6 (Fear) based upon the presence
of fear alone. The aspect of the maps that deals with unusual
raptures (both physical and mental) is less suggestible, and is a
more reliable indicator of the stage of practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, the
fundamental increases and shifts in perceptual thresholds are
extremely hard to fake, particularly if you have access to a map that
goes into the extensive details presented here. Shifts in perceptual
thresholds are the most reliable markers on the path of insight, the
Gold Standard by which these stages are defined. For example, if you
recently saw very fine vibrations that changed frequency with the
breath, then had a big zap-through, spaced out for a while, and now
feel paranoid with some steady 5-7 Hz stuff that quickly leads to
chaotic, edgy vibrations with complex harmonics, that’s very likely
the insight stage Fear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, increasing
one’s perceptual thresholds in terms of speed, consistency, and
inclusiveness should always be the focus of one’s insight
practices. Skilled teachers who use and are very good with these maps
will take into account all three, i.e. emotions, raptures and
perceptual abilities, along with the pattern of these that has
unfolded previously, and use these to come up with an educated guess
as to what is going on with a student. With years of experience, we
may eventually get good at doing this for ourselves. I have found
that my guesses about my own practice are usually more accurate after
I have had a year or two to reflect on what has occurred.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The best, most
consistent practice I ever did was during a two-week Mahasi
Sayadaw-style retreat in Malaysia. This was my third retreat ever,
and I knew nothing whatsoever of the maps of the progress of insight,
very little theory, and had done almost no reading of the old texts.
I was simply doing noting practice. I had been told by a friend that
if I noted quickly and accurately all day long from the time I got up
until the time I went to sleep without breaks then good things would
happen. Well, from my point of view, all sorts of strange and largely
irritating things happened. However, I just kept noting quickly all
day long regardless. Things were getting pretty wild, then things
calmed down a bit, and finally I hit a wall. I could barely practice
at all. I would sit down and try to note and be walking away from the
cushion within a minute and before I realized what was happening. My
mind was so tight, irritated and buzzy that I felt I would soon
explode. It was immensely frustrating.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That night the abbot
played a scratchy old tape of a Burmese monk with a thick accent
describing the stages of insight. It blew my mind, as he described
exactly what I had gone through in the previous 13 days. I could
clearly see how the stages he was describing had unfolded, exactly
where I was and what I had to do. <i>I</i> <i>was</i> <i>also</i>
<i>astounded</i> <i>that</i> <i>the</i> <i>path</i> <i>could</i> <i>be</i>
<i>so</i> <i>reproducible</i> <i>and</i> <i>straightforward</i>, <i>that</i>
<i>I</i> <i>could</i> <i>just</i> <i>follow</i> <i>moronically</i>
<i>simple</i> <i>instructions</i> <i>and</i> <i>have</i> <i>it</i>
<i>all</i> <i>happen</i>. Those who want to get lost in the reaction,
“No, it isn’t so simple. Awakening is a great and intractable
mystery! You are lying! It mustn’t be so!” should take a few
moments to seriously question exactly how this disempowering and
inaccurate view helps them feel good about themselves. They should
then take a few moments to find another, more empowering view that
helps them feel good about themselves, step up to the plate, and hit
a home run.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">With a very high
level of faith in the technique and despite the extremely irritating
restlessness that arose the moment I sat down, I resolved to sit on
the cushion until I had passed Re-observation. It was horrible. I
noted like crazy anyway. Within five minutes it broke, everything
opened up, and fundamental formations arose. Thus, knowledge of these
maps is absolutely not necessary for progress but it may be helpful
if it keeps one practicing and helps one realize that what is
happening may be perfectly normal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Unfortunately, the
story continues on a dark note. I did not know these maps well at the
time. I didn’t really appreciate what was happening, how close I
was to a real breakthrough, and the possible implications of not
doing so. The retreat ended one hour later, and I had very little
time for practice when my rigorous travels resumed. I fell back, back
into the Dark Night, and it began to really screw up my life. I won’t
go into details, but I will say that I wish I had access to a friend
with a solid understanding of these maps to help me keep what I was
going through in perspective. As it was, I was largely blindsided.
Since then I have met numerous people in similar unfortunate
situations. The wish to help others avoid such difficult situations
was one of my primary motivations for writing this book.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It was another six
months before I went on retreat again, and luckily by that point I
wanted nothing in the world more than release. In the month before I
arrived, I was lucky enough to have a friend clearly explain the
importance of noticing impermanence at a very fine level and show me
some of the finer points of the maps. I hit the retreat determined to
practice to the very best of my ability or die trying.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I powered up above
the Arising and Passing Away again on day 3, hit the Dark Night on
day 4, faltered for a few hours, and then simply noted. I knew I was
beaten, but I noted. I was weary, tight and yet volatile, and I
noted. I felt I was cracking at the seams, but I noted. I stayed with
what was happening, clearly perceiving and reluctantly accepting the
sensations that made up my world, the weight lifted, and then the
little mush demon buddha thing showed up. Soon thereafter, I soared
effortlessly in realms of pure vibrating suchness, free from the
ordinary cares of the world. Soon this became boring, and then I just
sat and walked. On day 6 of my fourth retreat, I got the first taste
of what I was looking for (read, “stream entry”). There is no way
to explain the waves of gratitude that washed over me, except that
one small ripple of them was the other part of the motivation for
writing this book. As promised, the spiritual path is not a linear
one. During the next few days, I swung wide from the greatest
spiritual highs to the extremes of what can happen during
Re-observation. My mind was powerful beyond reason, and yet I was a
complete novice at this new territory. I was a bit like a 16-year-old
who has just been given a Ferrari with no brakes and a pair of night
vision goggles. I simultaneously saw myself as being staggeringly
wise and also as a complete basket case. For the remainder of the
retreat, I worked to stabilize, ground and regroup so that when the
retreat ended I wouldn’t make a complete mess of things. I was only
moderately successful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For the next few
weeks, I, The Great Stream Enterer, managed to alienate most of the
people who had the misfortune to speak with me for any length of
time. Worse, within four weeks I began experiencing the difficult
physical raptures of the next set of early insight stages. New
territory was showing up, probably because I was still practicing
hard three or more hours each day, and it was kicking my gung–ho
butt. My neck went so stiff in the next 3rd insight stage that I
could barely move my head for nine days, and the pain was
excruciating. Again, I had no idea what was happening. Many years
later, I have come to the conclusion that the best thing to do after
attaining a path is to chill out for a while. I did have a senior
teacher tell me that much, but he didn’t tell me why. Further, I
had been advised by a good friend to do otherwise. Lord, help us when
meditation teachers give us blatantly contradictory instructions,
particularly in intensive practice situations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No one had told me
that the beginning of a new progress of insight could arise so
quickly, or informed me of what it could be like to be trapped in the
odd in-between stages by pushing too hard. Again, I wished I had the
advantage of knowing someone who was willing to talk about these
things honestly. However, despite my continued contact with senior
meditation teachers, no one was willing to lay out the practical
information that I present here. I had to figure it out the hard way.
Was I bitter? You bet I was. Was I simultaneously very grateful to
even have these things to be bitter about? Absolutely. Finally,
someone gave me the excellent advice, “Nail down what you’ve
got.” Within a few weeks of relaxing and letting things settle, I
was able to backslide to mastery of the previous stages and get on
with my life. Despite these rough beginnings and a rough journey
beyond them, do I have any major regrets? No. It has been so very
beneficial that I cannot possibly explain it. I wouldn’t be going
on and on about these things if they weren’t worth it. However, I
am a firm believer that if there is enough good information out
there, then it doesn’t have to be so hard for those that follow.
Thus, I present these maps with the hope that they will help people
at least have some framework to help them understand the many and
varied parts of the path.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, as absurd
as this may sound to some, the maps allow you to plan your spiritual
path to some degree. True, there are ultimate points of view that
would make this perspective seem quite ridiculous, but indulge me. A
sample plan might be this:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. Go on a
three-week retreat and really power the mindfulness and investigation
all day long, consistently stretching your perceptual threshold and
speed of investigation to its limits to maximize the chances of
crossing the A&amp;P Event. It is not that hard to cross the A&amp;P
with fairly imbalanced effort, so don’t worry about that. Remember
not to be freaked out by the strange raptures around the A&amp;P.
Note, a two to three month retreat would give you a great shot at
stream entry if you are ready to really practice, so if you are at
that level, go for it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. Once you have
crossed the A&amp;P, Dark Night stuff will come bubbling up soon
enough, and the choice to deal with this on or off retreat will
depend upon how much time you can devote to retreats and how much
intensity you can stand. My vote tends to be for on retreat if you
can take the heat, but not everyone can the first time around and not
everyone can easily spare the time. On the other hand, that Dark
Night might just be a cakewalk. Give it a go and find out! In the
Mahasi Sayadaw tradition, they typically think that two to three
months of diligent noting practice on intensive retreat is enough to
get many people to stream entry, but perhaps you do not have the time
or dedication to step to that level yet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you decide to
deal with the Dark Night off retreat, realize that you will likely
fall back but keep practicing an hour or two each day. Do your very
best to realize that any of the odd feelings that you may experience
are probably just Dark Night side effects. Try to imitate normal life
as best you can and avoid rash decisions such as sudden and permanent
renunciations of things you will want later on. Try to be nice to
people and do your very best to keep your “stuff” from bleeding
onto those around you. Find ways to honor and deal with your stuff
that don’t involve projecting it out onto other people or making a
mess of your life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. If on retreat, or
the next time you can go on retreat, just keep practicing as
consistently and accurately as you can and avoid indulging in the
content of your stuff at all costs. Put worldly concerns behind you
for that period of time and investigate bare sensations with
acceptance and bravery.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">4. Attain to
equanimity regarding whatever arises, but be wary of indifference.
This is not always as easy as it sounds, but it could be strangely
easy nonetheless. Once the weight lifts, just keep sitting or walking
or whatever, with no sense of special effort. After really getting
into high equanimity, stream entry should arise soon enough; if it
doesn’t, repeat the above cycles until it does.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">5. From this point,
you are “in there,” and progress of some kind is now inevitable.
This first finger-hold on ultimate reality is extremely important, as
without it you can wander far and wide and yet get nowhere. Advice
for what to do next is given later on.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5602_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_83"></a><a name="27__THE_THREE_DOORS"></a>
27. THE THREE DOORS</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Insight practice is
all about understanding the Three Characteristics so that when we
deeply understand them we may see beyond the three illusions and
enter ultimate reality through one of the Three Doors. Stages 12-14
and subsequent attainments of Fruition at that level of awakening
present as radical and complete understandings of the Three
Characteristics at the level of formations, i.e. at the level of the
whole sensate universe, lasting three or four moments of one tenth to
one quarter of a second each. As unpalatable as the Three
Characteristics can seem, in the end they are the source and
substance of our complete salvation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are three
basic ways the doors may present themselves, which I will describe
shortly, at least two of which are combined to produce the experience
of entering ultimate reality. The third characteristic is considered
inferred from the way the other two present, but sometimes aspects of
that third characteristic will be experienced directly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Regardless of the
way that door manifests, there are some common characteristics of
doors that point to something beyond all of this. They reveal
something completely extraordinary about the relationship between
“the watcher” and “the watched” that it would take a very
warped view of the universe to explain, though I will try shortly.
One way or another, these fleeting experiences cannot be explained in
terms of our normal, four-dimensional experience of space and time,
or within our ordinary experience of a subject and object.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One way to sort out
a door to ultimate reality from an A&amp;P Event is that the Three
Doors involve the whole experiential space-time continuum as well as
the object of investigation, as these become the same thing, an
integrated whole. This does not hold absolutely for A&amp;P Events if
we are being honest with ourselves, as the subtle background of
sensations that provide reference points is not completely included.
Further, A&amp;P Events tend to be very rich and thick, whereas there
is always a sort of silent and luminous transparency to the way the
Three Doors present. As stated earlier, the A&amp;P Event occurs very
much as the Three Doors, is then followed by an unknowing event, but
then there are a few moments (usually about 3 or 4) as the breath
drops all the way to the bottom, followed by another unknowing event
and a state shift.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Without doubt, the
clearest and most illuminating experiences of the Three Doors come
from attaining Fruition in the formless realms or in the realms of
the “psychic powers,” though these are not necessary, just very
interesting, memorable and educational. Another perspective would say
that the Three Doors always happen at the level of the psychic
powers, but this is a matter of semantics. The strength of one's
concentration practice and the recent continuity of practice will
also help determine how clear these experiences are. I had to go
through them hundreds of times with an eye to exactly how they
presented before I was able to write a chapter such as this one. The
entrance to Fruition through one of these doors is always completely
unexpected.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will explain the
aspect that each characteristic lends to each door and then combine
these to explain what actually happens. When particularly clear
experiences of the three quick moments of the Three Doors occur, they
can provide fundamental clues that can be used for further debunking
the Three Illusions, as well as explaining where so many of the
teachings that try to describe the true nature of things come from.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, the
impermanence door aspect has to do with mind moments (the particle
model), arising and passing, vibrations, understanding that from
which all this arises and that to which all this returns,
understanding the source of all reality, the universe strobing in and
out of existence, and that sort of thing. When the Tibetans talk of
non-existence, they refer to the fact that all experience is utterly
transient (the wave model) and thus abides or exists not at all but
is constantly in absolute flux and ephemeral. The impermanence door
aspect relates to realizing what is “between the frames” of the
sensate universe (formations), and it tends to have a
“dat.dat.dat-(gone)!” quality to it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The suffering door
aspect has to do with fundamental attachment, dropping attachment
like a hot coal that one finally realized one was holding, really
letting go, compassion, ultimate bodhichitta, the true love of God,
being purged in the flames, renunciation, relinquishment, feeling the
fundamental queasy tension in the illusion of duality for just a bit
longer than one ever would normally, and that sort of thing. The
suffering door relates directly to “the mind” releasing its
fixated hold on the whole of relative reality and allowing it to fall
away, leaving “awareness” to discover itself. Remember, these
words in quotes do not refer to fixed phenomena or experiences. It
can also feel like the sum total of existence is suddenly ripped away
from us. The suffering door aspect tends to be the most unsettling or
wrenching of the Three Doors, the most death-like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The no-self or
emptiness door aspect has to do with the teachings on the mirror-like
nature of the mind, the Spirit of God moving upon the face of the
waters (that oh so mystical and overlooked line from Genesis 1.2),
God making man in his image, merging with a tantric image of a
buddha, seeing one's Original Face, thinking of who created thought,
and that sort of thing. It relates to directly observing the collapse
of the illusion of duality, the collapse of awareness into the
intelligence or cognition of the perceived. It is a bit like staring
back at yourself (or something intelligent regardless of whether or
not it looks like you) with no one on this side to be stared at and
then collapsing into that image. The emptiness door aspect tends to
be the most pleasant, easy and visually interesting of the three.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Each of these doors
has to do with complete understanding of the ultimate aspect of
relative reality, and thus realizing the ultimate nature of ultimate
reality. Each door also relates in some way to completely countering
one of the three fundamental defilements. The impermanence door
relates to countering fundamental ignorance. The suffering door
relates to countering fundamental attachment. The emptiness door
relates to countering fundamental aversion. From a True Self point of
view, the impermanence door relates to the permanence of ultimate
reality, the suffering door relates to the compassionate nature of
ultimate reality or ultimate bodhichitta, and emptiness door relates
to the fact that The Void is “what” we truly are (in True Self
parlance at least).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When I use the word
“fundamental,” I always mean something to do with basic illusions
of duality or the gradual or sudden elimination thereof. Thus, I use
the word “fundamental” when what I am talking about has nothing
to do with specific content, emotions, physical sensations, mind
states, psychological manifestations or understandings, or any other
specific and limited categories of sensations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will now try to
describe six possible combinations of these three aspects that create
the actual experiences of the three doors. While there can be quite a
lot of variation in the specifics of how these doors present, they
will always fall into one of these basic patterns. As I stated
earlier, these events are so brief and sometimes so unclear that
persons who have been through them many times may not understand that
they present in the way I describe them here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When the
impermanence aspect predominates and is combined with the emptiness
aspect, then the whole universe strobes three times quickly with
something staring back at us as a minor aspect of that universe, and
then it seems that awareness collapses into the space after the third
gap, perhaps turning slightly towards the thing that was staring
back. When the impermanence aspect predominates and is combined with
the suffering aspect, then the three strobing moments feel wrenching,
and the plunge into the gap feels fundamentally violating, like
exactly the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When the emptiness
aspect predominates and is combined with the impermanence door, there
are three clear and discrete moments of moving towards or sideways to
(or perhaps focusing on) an intelligent seeing image staring back at
us, except that there is nothing on this side. After the third
moment, the illusion collapses in a very natural and pleasant way.
When the emptiness door predominates with suffering as its second
aspect, then a very strange thing happens. There is an image on one
side staring back, and then the universe becomes a toroid (doughnut),
and the image and this side of the toroid change places as the toroid
universe spins. The spinning includes the whole background of space
in all directions. Fruition occurs when the two have changed places
and the whole thing vanishes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When the suffering
aspect predominates and is combined with the emptiness aspect, again,
the toroid thing happens, except that it can be a quite distorted or
cone-like. The universe can rotate up or down and away from us, so
that the primary experience is of an image falling from this side,
though with the hint that it might be coming back around to this
side. When the suffering door aspect predominates with impermanence
present, then the three moments in which the universe is ripped away
from us are distinct. When the suffering door predominates, the
experience is always a bit creepy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For those working on
the higher paths, reflecting on the ways that the few moments before
fruition have presented themselves can be very interesting and
helpful. For those working on the last stage of awakening, I offer
the following advice. The special ways that the doors can present can
seem to imply the following:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">- That there is a
link between some special and intelligent spot on that side and some
transcendent this that is unfindable. This is implied by the
definable qualities of that spot and certain subtle sensations
implying space.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">- That there is some
space around space, some transcendent super-space around the universe
that we may try to rest in or imagine is here. This is implied by
sensations with definable qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">- That there is some
void-like potential that creates all of this and to which all of this
returns. This is implied by sensations with specific and definable
qualities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Seeing that these
qualities that seemed to imply something very special are actually
just more qualities that we have misinterpreted as being a potential
refuge reveals the refugeless refuge. Reflecting and investigating in
this way, the last illusions may fall away and we may attain to the
complete elimination of all fundamental illusions, or at least the
next level of the fractal.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5604_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_84"></a><a name="28__WAS_THAT_EMPTINESS"></a>
28.“WAS THAT EMPTINESS?”</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Welcome to the world
of models, states, stages, and visions of goals to attain. The curse
and blessing of knowing all of this terminology and theory is that
there is a natural tendency to begin to try to apply it to our own
experiences (and those of others) and wonder what was what. Beyond
that, not only have I just provided enough information for a few of
you to become Master Posers on the spiritual path, I have just given
some of you enough information to start obsessing way too much about
“where you are” on the path. However, this is a trivial danger,
and why senior dharma teachers do not ever seem to put the important
details about sorting out what is what into their books is completely
beyond me. That it should be left to a young and cocky upstart like
myself to fill in this gap is less than ideal. Note, when I use the
word “emptiness” in the title of this chapter, I am using it
specifically to refer to a Fruition, and in this case generally mean
stream entry, and not any other meaning. It has many other meanings,
but this is the specific one I care about at this moment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are all sorts
of pitfalls that can occur, but perhaps the most significant of them
all is calling experiences “emptiness,” “Fruition”, “Stream
Entry” or “Nirvana” that simply weren’t. It is a mistake that
we are all likely to make more than once if we practice fairly well,
know these models and care about them in the least, and even very
enlightened beings with years of practice will sometimes wonder, “Was
that emptiness?”, meaning “Was that my hit?”, or “Was that
the next stage of awakening?”. Some of us will be particularly
prone to blowing this on a regular basis even if we are actually
somewhat enlightened. Take heart, failure can be a great teacher.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first and
perhaps most important point is that from a certain point of view it
is not an important question. If you have actually gotten enlightened
to some degree or attained a Fruition, the permanent benefits of that
have occurred regardless of whether or not you are certain about it.
On the other hand, if you haven’t gotten enlightened but think that
you have, it is worth being able to come back to reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The range of clarity
with which the Three Doors to Fruition present themselves can be
quite wide. Sometimes, even if it was actually the attainment of
Fruition, there may not have been enough clarity at the time for
one’s memory of the way that particular door presented and of the
depth of the discontinuity to be clear enough to satisfactorily
answer the question.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are also a
large number of possible momentary unknowing experiences that can
present in ways that seem convincingly like the attainment of
Fruition, even for meditators with years of experience with these
issues. I will mention some of the most common events that can be
mistaken for Fruition here, though this is far from being a complete
list.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Momentary
experiences of the formless realms that arise in the insight stage of
11. Equanimity, particularly nothingness and neither perception nor
yet non-perception, are common culprits. However, if one is this
close, the real thing is very likely to occur sooner or later.
Formless experiences arising from pure concentration practices have
fooled people for millennia into thinking they were Fruitions. As
mentioned earlier, insight stage 4. The Arising and Passing Away,
particularly the Arising and Passing Away Event itself, is a
pernicious trickster and has fooled countless practitioners
throughout the ages into thinking it was Fruition or the attainment
of a path. This may even fool somewhat enlightened beings who are
working on the next path. Note, the A&amp;P Event typically shows up
only once per path unless a long period of time goes by without
practice after it, whereas Fruition is likely to be repeated
naturally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Unusually heavy
experiences of insight stage 5. Dissolution can be formless and murky
enough to fool some meditators on occasion, as can any really
dramatic shift between any of the vipassana or samatha jhanas (as
these involve three or four “impulsions” or “mind moments”
followed by a momentary unknowing experience; see <u>The</u>&nbsp;
<u>Abhidhamma</u> in the Pali Canon). Even the first shift into
insight stage 1. Mind and Body can fool some novices if is happens
dramatically enough and they get fascinated with how unitive,
pleasant and clear the stage can be after the first shift into it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Often it is not
possible to make a clear call about what was what, even if it was
actually Fruition. While what follows is routinely considered to be
dangerous information, I am happy to go to the far extreme of telling
largely taboo secrets if it helps to balance the pervasive “mushroom”
culture. These are some basic guidelines that may be used when trying
to answer the question, “Was that emptiness?”:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– If there was any
sense of an experience, even of nothingness or something that seemed
incomprehensible, <i>particularly</i> <i>anything</i> <i>involving</i>
<i>the</i> <i>vaguest</i> <i>hint</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>passage</i>
<i>of</i> <i>time</i> <i>during</i> <i>it</i>, write it off as
something other than emptiness. This is an absolute rule.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– Similarly, if
there was any sense of a this observing a that, or a self of any sort
that was actually present for whatever happened, write it off as
something other than emptiness. If you were there, that wasn’t it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– If there was not
a complete sense of discontinuity and if it makes any sense to think
of time, space, perspective or memory continuing across the gap,
write it off immediately as something other than emptiness. On the
other hand, if the only way to remember what happed involves
remembering just forward to the end of the particular door that
presented and then remembering back to when reality reappeared, well,
keep reading.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– If on continued
repetition of the unknowing event over days or weeks it fails the
above tests, write it off as something other than emptiness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– If continued
repetition of that particular kind of unknowing event over days or
weeks fails to give any clear experiences of the Three Doors and to
reveal something very paradoxical and profound about the nature of
subject and object, be skeptical.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– If there was a
double-dip into unknowing events with a few profound moments of
clarity and altered experience between them, as is characteristic of
the A&amp;P Event, with one shift happening halfway down the
out-breath and a second shift at the end of that out-breath, write it
off immediately as more likely having been that or maybe the early
stages of Equanimity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– If the event
cannot be repeated, write it off. Those who have attained a path will
attain more Fruitions naturally, maybe one to many per day, as they
basically can't help but cycle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If there is not a
rather predictable pattern of stages and perspective shifts that
begins to become clear (specifically following the course of the
progress of insight listed above in some way, particularly as regards
shifts in perceptual thresholds), write it off as something other
than emptiness.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This brings me to
the Cardinal Rule when trying to sort out what all experiences or
attainments actually were: <i>try</i> <i>to</i> <i>repeat</i> <i>it</i>
<i>again</i> <i>and</i> <i>again</i> <i>and</i> <i>be</i> <i>honest</i>
<i>with</i> <i>yourself</i>. It literally took me many of thousands
of times through these cycles and experiences at many levels and over
many years to get to the point where I could even begin to think
about writing a book like this one. I am still quite cautious about
hanging my hat on interpretations of my experiences or what seem to
be non-experiences until I have attained them 50, 100 or even more
times. If you don’t have the necessary level of clarity and mastery
to repeat the experience of interest again and again, either do
enough clear and diligent practice to attain the required mastery or
don’t ask the question. Studying theory can only be so useful for
this. In the end and always, it is practice and continued direct
experience that reveals and clarifies. While it is somewhat true that
with clarity comes mystery, this maxim can easily be used as a cop
out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A related question
is, “Am I enlightened?” I have met a number of people recently
who have exhibited a common but unhealthy fascination with this
question, toying with the possibility that they were enlightened in
“past lives” (whatever), were enlightened earlier in their life
and “repressed it” (not!), were enlightened by interesting
experiences that were bound up in time and space (whoops!), such as
A&amp;P Events, formless realm experiences, visions of beings,
unusual raptures, etc. For these sorts of people, as well as those
working on higher paths who are stuck in the in-between stages, I
offer the following:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first thing one
must know about enlightened beings is that Fruitions occur for them,
and they do so naturally and fairly often. True, there may sometimes
be an initial period after first attaining a path when they might not
happen so often (the range being from once every day to once every
week or so at the very longest). However, Fruitions are largely
unavoidable. It would take lots of consistent work to keep them from
happening, and if one let one’s guard down they would show up again
quickly enough. In fact, the longer one goes without a Fruition, the
more the pull towards that which is not any of this intensifies.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Even those who are
working on the next path will typically have recurring Fruitions from
the current path sneak in even if they don’t want them to. This is
one way to distinguish A&amp;P Events from Fruitions, as crossing
above the level of the A&amp;P quickly diminishes in intensity, fades
quickly as the focus of one’s practice, and fails to provide the
consistent sense of release, ease and sense of well-being that
attaining a Fruition does.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Before
enlightenment, one always had to developing access concentration,
attaining Mind and Body and working from there every time they
meditated (unless practicing very strongly, often and well, when one
may be able to keep up enough momentum to avoid falling back to the
beginning). After attaining a path one begins at the level of the
Arising and Passing Away and proceeds with much more skill and
confidence. Simply reflecting on reality even slightly will result in
a nearly instantaneous shift to a Mind and Body-like state. At a
whim, one can begin meditating at the level of the A&amp;P, beginning
with the double-dip state shift at the middle and then end of the out
breath that is the hallmark of that stage. Thus, enlightened beings
can perceive vibrating phenomena at a whim.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In that same vein,
<i>the</i> <i>cycles</i> <i>of</i> <i>insight</i> <i>from</i> <i>stage</i>
<i>4</i> <i>to</i> <i>11</i> <i>and</i> <i>then</i> <i>15</i> <i>always</i>
<i>influence</i> <i>the</i> <i>conscious</i> <i>life</i> <i>of</i>
<i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>are</i> <i>enlightened</i>. They are
inescapable. They cycle endlessly in one’s waking hours and even
when dreaming. They subtly or overtly color one’s mood, energy
level and perception of the world. As soon as a Fruition is attained,
the cycle starts again and proceeds, though the timing and
obviousness of this fact may be somewhat variable depending on how
much one is practicing, what is going on in one’s life and how good
one is at noticing the qualities of these stages. Even when doing
concentration practices, these cycles are in the background
somewhere. It is possible to ignore them to a large degree for a
while when in deep samatha jhanas, though it takes work to do so.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I remember lying
down to take a nap after lunch when on retreat in India a few days
after my first Fruition. Before I knew it, meditation was occurring.
The cycles were showing themselves in order without any effort or
even invitation. They had their individual qualities much as I have
explained above, though they move fairly quickly from one to the
other, and about 45 minutes later Fruition occurred. Soon thereafter,
it was obvious that the cycle had started again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Do you cycle
naturally through the cycles of insight from stage four to eleven and
then attain Fruition? If you just sat down on a cushion and did
nothing special, would you move through these stages as easily as
falling down a hill? Do Fruitions arise after such cycles in a way
that fairly consistently leaves you with the staggering impression
that, “that was it!”? If not, I would avoid harboring any notions
that you are enlightened, “have been enlightened some time in the
past,” etc., as you are almost certainly in error. Such notions are
not helpful most of the time anyway, and tend to be bound up in a
sense of solidity and imagined continuity of self that is simply
unrealistic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have a friend who
erroneously thinks he is enlightened and once said, “Oh, yes, I
went through those stages once many years ago, but now I am beyond
them.” Toast! Those who are enlightened go through these stages
hundreds if not thousands of times each year. There is absolutely no
getting around them barring deep sleep, severe brain damage, strong
sedation or death.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, it is fair
to mention that some enlightened people simply don’t think about
things in this way, have never noticed that they cycled, never picked
up on the patterns, were never exposed to the maps, don’t have
particularly strong concentration, don’t realize how they got
there, are not particularly intellectual or, if they are, never
applied their intellect to these aspects of where theory meets
practice, never really paid attention to the way things unfold, and
couldn’t care less. Thus, if someone is enlightened, I brazenly
assert they cycle like this, but that doesn’t mean they realize
they do, and if their practice unfolded gently or slowly or without
very intense concentration and a map-oriented focus, they may have no
idea about most of the things I am discussing here and yet they apply
to them anyway. I poured massive amounts of energy into my practice,
developed very strong concentration, and care about the maps
obsessively, but that doesn’t mean that other beings who are
enlightened did or do. Back to describing the cycles. As Review sets
in, it can seem that one can control these cycles and stages. It may
seem after we have mastered a path somewhat that we can call insight
stages up in order and stay in them as long as we wish or even call
them up out of order. From one point of view, enlightened beings can
master and manipulate the stages of insight, though such practices
can take on much more of a samatha feel than an insight feel. From
another point of view, perhaps a more thoroughly insight-oriented
point of view, even such a notion is erroneous. Stages, cycles, and
the empty intentions to manipulate them occur in a causal fashion,
and if there is a sense that there is an independent self that is
controlling them, then there is obviously more work to do. Now,
there’s a high standard, and worthy standard, indeed! These cycles,
as with everything else, simply belong to the nature of things.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5606_1179888903"></a><a name="29__BEYOND_FIRST_PATH___WHAT_NEX"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_85"></a>
29. BEYOND FIRST PATH (“WHAT NEXT?”)</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Obviously, it can be
easy for a meditator to think that they have completed a progress of
insight and gotten stream entry when in fact they haven’t. It is
also possible for a meditator to have actually completed a progress
of insight and yet think otherwise, but this is much less common.
Sometimes a student will be correct in thinking that they have, but
their teachers will remain unconvinced. Sometimes a teacher may think
that the student has and yet be wrong. Regardless, just keep
practicing and see what happens. This is the most fundamental
principle for all of these stages. A particularly useful and
traditional guideline is to wait a year and a day before completely
making up your mind. This is slippery stuff sometimes, and many
states and stages can easily fool a student or teacher into thinking
that they are something they are not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When a meditator
successfully completes a progress of insight, they have permanently
debunked certain illusions to some degree, but many remain. These
tend to include a new fascination with the understanding that has
arisen from that path. However, if one’s “realization” doesn’t
stand to the test of time, or if there is not some sort of
fundamental and unalterable reduction in suffering, write it off and
keep going. Even if one does complete a progress of insight, is easy
to imagine that more has been debunked than actually has, so continue
to practice training in morality throughout your life as before to
avoid being bitten by those unskillful potentials that remain but are
hidden. Strangely, the temptations to screw up can become more subtle
and seductive as practice deepens. These tend to be at their worst
around the next Arising and Passing Away or during the next
Re-observation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">An extended series
of progresses of insight tend to proceed as follows. They may be
called “Paths” in the Theravada and “Bhumis” in the Tibetan,
though there are some problems that arise in trying to resolve the
inconsistencies in these two models that will be touched on a bit
later. Thus, a more general treatment follows, and the descriptions
of the stages here are not taken directly from any particular
tradition. From one point of view, all of this is not necessary
information, as continued practice just as before will continue to
move things along quite naturally. On the other hand, if one has
expectations about what might come next that are not in accord with
reality or interfere with practice, then this information might be
helpful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The meditator
masters this stage of awakening by continued practice as before. They
can quickly learn to rise through all of the stages, starting from
the Arising and Passing Away, through the Dark Night, up to
Equanimity and Fruition in a single sitting or even during some of
the activities of daily life. Merely sitting down on a cushion, or
being awake for that matter, will involve naturally moving through
these cycles, thought the speed and clarity of these can vary widely
depending on the practitioner and circumstances. They may even find
it interesting to purposefully hang out in some of the stages of the
Dark Night just to learn more about them and from them, as they have
some very important lessons to teach and are very interesting
territory. However, they may also come to realize that this is really
just a new beginning in some ways, sort of like graduating from high
school but then becoming a lowly freshman in college.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The period after
completing a progress of insight and <i>after</i> <i>gaining</i> <i>some</i>
<i>strong</i> <i>sense</i> <i>of</i> <i>mastery</i> <i>of</i> <i>its</i>
<i>stages</i> is also a great time to work on one’s concentration
practice abilities. The reason for waiting is that concentration
practices and insight practices tend to have a certain inertia to
them. If you have recently been trying to get into really stable
samatha states, this can make it harder to see things flicker for a
while. If you have recently been training hard to see things flicker,
it can be hard to get into really stable samatha jhanas. Thus, what
you don’t want to do is to gunk up the natural mastery phase of
your practice until you are comfortable enough with these stages to
get stuck in one and not have it be a big deal. This usually takes at
least a few weeks, but this is a very crude guideline, and everyone
is different regarding issues of timing. Judge for yourself how well
you handle stages such as Re-observation and decide if you would be
alright if you got stuck in it for a few hours.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The time after
gaining some mastery of these stages is also a great time to work on
one’s stuff. Actually, doing concentration practices and working on
one’s stuff go very well together, as concentration states tend to
cause our stuff to come bubbling to the surface where we can work
with it. The time during a mastery phase is also a great time to make
sure that one’s daily life is functioning well, particularly if one
made a mess of it while trying to get enlightened or more
enlightened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Mastery of these
stages tends to peak at some point, and the sense can arise that one
has really “got it.” Fruitions tend to occur fairly quickly,
clearly and easily. Given time and practice, they may begin to become
somewhat bored with their current level of attainment and with their
ability to attain these stages and Fruition. Their practice can begin
to seem sloppy, and the quiet bliss wave after Fruition can diminish
somewhat unless they do not attain it for some long period of time
(which would probably require resolutions to that effect).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The understanding
that there is more suffering to uproot grows. They begin to see more
levels of reality that are clearly not well understood or illuminated
by their current understanding, hints of which probably showed
themselves very soon after their attainment of that path. Subtle
thoughts and mental patterns may be noticed at the edge of one’s
perceptual threshold. Attention begins to incline towards the next
level of reality that must be understood and away from familiar
territory. More fresh insights begin to show up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They begin to
investigate reality with more effort and clarity as before and begin
a new progress of insight from the beginning, i.e. access
concentration and then Mind and Body and the rest. This might play
out as follows: fairly soon after the sense of strong mastery, one
will simply be meditating along, perhaps a Fruition will occur, and
then suddenly the mind drops into this new state rather than a new
review cycle beginning again. It is stable, interesting, and somewhat
jhana-like. It is sort of like re-inhabiting one’s life or
reconnecting with the sense of the observer. It is also likely the
next Mind and Body. This could also happen when one was just going
about one’s day.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The postural
obsession, odd movements, strange tensions and pains, emotional
volatility, vibratory stuff that seems new, a fresh and clearer sense
of what dualistic perspectives remain, and all of the other early
progress of insight stuff may arise in its time naturally and perhaps
sooner than one might wish. The phrase “leading onward” is often
used to describe the wisdom that arises from dharma practice.
Strangely, it is a phrase and a fact that I have cursed just as often
as blessed, and entering new insight territory at inopportune times
or before one feels ready can reveal why. Insight cycles can
sometimes be very traumatic, and it is often advisable to take a
break to recover one’s sense of humor and appreciation of life
before plunging on. However, at this point the dharma waits for no
one and may plunge on regardless of your wishes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Note well, for those
in between stages, there initially is still the ability to easily
attain any of the previous stages starting at the level of the
current Arising and Passing Away, so things can get quite murky if
they are trying to figure out what stage they are in or attain
specific new stages. It can be as if the early stages are opening up
to us, whereas for a while things always started out at the level of
the Arising and Passing away.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Fixating on thoughts
about what stage you are in is guaranteed to cause some degree of
suffering that is worthy of investigation, especially in the in
between stages, though a gentle awareness of the maps can still be
slightly useful. There can be a sort of a fork in the path for a
while, with the meditator seemingly being able to choose whether to
review previous stages or press on. It can seem as though the
background is solidifying and the mind is growing nosier as well as
less predictable and skillful. More of our stuff is suddenly bubbling
up to the surface. We notice subtler thoughts and mental images, many
of which we may wish we hadn’t. We may feel less “enlightened,”
as if our realization were fading. Clear and consistent insight
practice, i.e. understanding the Three Characteristics of all types
of sensations, which includes thoughts of maps and goals, is the only
thing that finally helps, just as before.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">After the meditator
crosses the next Arising and Passing Away Event, which may happen
relatively quickly if they practice well and often, they will tend to
have a very hard time re-attaining Fruition for a while. One may
meditate along and then get stuck in a stage that seems to lead
nowhere and is sort of like low equanimity, in that there are clear
vibrations that are not varying with the breath or any other
movement, and yet the background is too dense, noisy and poorly
perceived for clear and complete formations to show themselves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Finding the
proverbial fork in the road to familiar territory can now be quite
tricky, and even if they do find the way back, the old territory is
unlikely to be particularly appealing. Old Fruitions may arise, but
they may do so in a way that is less reliable or certain. Suddenly,
the meditator is “on the ride” again, and will soon have to face
the fullness of the next Dark Night with all of its implications. It
may even be more challenging than before, but could just as easily be
less so. One friend of mine sailed through one Dark Night in about
six minutes, and the next one took him many years. There is no
predicting these issues of timing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It can happen that
many times they will try to meditate to equanimity but fall back when
they get to Re-observation. They may thus try to re-attain previous
stages, as they may feel in over their heads. They may get into the
next stage of Desire for Deliverance, wish very strongly to go beyond
all of this, and do so by re-attaining to a Fruition of the current
path instead of attaining the next one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, even if
they are able to retreat into the old territory, they will still be
haunted to some degree by the Dark Night in their life and will have
to learn to navigate skillfully in this territory one way or another.
Sometimes re-mastering the current path is helpful for building a
sufficient foundation from which to proceed well into the new
territory. Eventually, there is no way to go back, and one is simply
left facing the new territory without an obvious skillful escape
route.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There can arise an
odd phenomenon that has been referred to by one of my teachers as
“Twelfth Path,” though this phrase is not in common usage. <i>It</i>
<i>is</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>a</i> <i>common</i> <i>phenomenon</i>
<i>in</i> <i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>have</i> <i>attained</i> <i>at</i>
<i>least</i> <i>stream</i> <i>entry</i> <i>and</i> <i>is</i> <i>probably</i>
<i>the</i> <i>most</i> <i>important</i> <i>concept</i> <i>in</i> <i>this</i>
<i>book</i> <i>for</i> <i>those</i> <i>working</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i>
<i>higher</i> <i>paths</i>, <i>particularly</i> <i>beyond</i> <i>second</i>
<i>path</i>. Twelfth Path is making a joke about the fact that there
are at most four stages of enlightenment in the Theravada map and
five or ten in the Tibetan maps. However, it can easily seem that
more than ten brand-new and full-blown cycles of insight have been
completed and yet there is still much more to go. If one is going to
get obsessed with the fractal model that I mentioned earlier, it is
likely to happen around here. Unfortunately, the fractal model is
even more useless now than it was earlier, and so I strongly
recommend avoiding it like the plague if you think you are in a new
progress cycle rather than a review cycle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Things might proceed
as follows. It seems certain that a cycle has been completed. Next,
there seems to be a clear mastery stage that withstands all of the
most rigorous tests, then more early progress of insight stuff shows
up, the cycle begins to go around again, perhaps with more
backsliding, moving forward, falling back again, remastering the old
territory, more progress and suffering shows up with its associated
struggles and rationalizations, then there comes a sense of there
being no other option but progress and acceptance, and finally the
sense that the cycle has completed itself. Soon enough there is a
clear sense of a mastery stage, and so on. In this way, it may seem
that some large number of paths or bhumis have been attained, twelve
in the joke, when in fact they have not. Or have they? Unfortunately,
this is a tough question, and one that cannot easily be resolved.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One may think that
one is now at a higher stage of realization that is clearly different
from before, but the “magic numbers” 4 or 10 simply may not seem
to apply to one’s journey. It can also happen that, with increased
clarity and progressive deepening of one’s practice, distinct
progress of insight patterns may seem to be repeating within each of
the smaller units of the larger pattern of the progress of insight,
very much in the way of fractals, as detailed earlier. Beware! Do not
get sucked into identifying with these idealized stages as actually
being “where you are”!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">New progress cycles
and their accompanying vagueness can be very confusing if we are
fixated on models but are not aware that the in-between territory is
nearly impossible to successfully map in real-time. We may sometimes
feel that we have just gone through the larger progress of insight
cycle when we may have actually only gone through a small part of it.
We may begin to think we see first, second, third and fourth
vipassana jhana aspects of each of the four larger vipassana jhanas.
We may even begin to see patterns similar to those of a full progress
of insight within each of the stages of the larger progress of
insight or even within parts of each stage. A similar observation can
arise in concentration practice with the samatha jhanas, but this
tends to not be nearly as problematic or dramatic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have come to the
conclusion that fear, anxiety, confusion, indecision and even
certainty about these issues are clear markers of what needs to be
investigated, i.e. those things themselves. In this way, these
aspects of suffering have become trusted friends, clear signposts and
red flags, as well as aspects of the goal, which is the path in the
end. The more we realize that those very processes are it, those very
sensations are it, the closer reality is to understanding itself. The
closer reality is to understanding itself, the less fundamental
suffering there is.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have also come to
the conclusion that the best reason to take these detailed maps to
this extreme is that eventually they become way too ridiculous and
cumbersome. Thus, eventually they can be laughed at and yet make
their few useful points also, while leaving us with no option but to
be with reality, one aspect of which is the sensations that make up
thoughts about maps. We can learn to laugh at ourselves and our
deep-seated but futile desire to simplify fresh patterns of
sensations and solidify them into a sense of an attainment that “we”
have.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the darker side,
when we are unable to do this, unable to laugh at our deluded
attempts to fix or freeze a sense of what some illusory “we” has
done or attained, the phenomena of Twelfth Path and the complexity of
the territory between paths can cause considerable doubt, pain,
frustration and cynicism, the flip side of which is grandiosity. The
more afraid we are of not making progress, the worse these sorts of
feelings can become. The more we compare our practice to the
misunderstood sensations that make up the sense of “others,” the
more needless suffering arises. These sensation patterns must be
investigated clearly and seen as they really are, as always.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When this all ends
is a subject of considerable controversy, though like an idiot I am
going to take on the topic of Full Enlightenment shortly. Anyway, it
should be noted that a long-term view is very helpful sometimes,
particularly if it helps one just be with what is happening today. It
will often not be clear which event was actually the new Arising and
Passing Event or which event was really a new Path until one has the
benefit of a few more months or years of practice. One may experience
many strange events, state shifts, insights and profound openings,
all of which can be very compelling for some period of time. However,
there tend to be just a few of these memories that, on careful
reflection, stand out in the mind as being really significant and by
which one can clearly mark permanent shifts in one’s fundamental
relationship to the experiences of life and the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the next chapter,
I will lay out a number of models of awakening that involve various
numbers of shifts in understanding. One may be tempted, as I
foolishly have been, to count the landmark events in one’s practice
and try to correlate them with these models based purely on the
number of them that seem to have occurred. This is a setup for
trouble, so please learn from those who have leaned the hard way and
do not try it, as tempting as counting paths can be. A vastly
superior form of inquiry and investigation is to carefully examine
anything that seems to involve a sense of a split, of a this and a
that, particularly at the rate of one to ten times per second or even
faster if you can pull it off. What sensations seem to be the
watcher, and what sensations seem to be watched? Try to see the true
nature of these sensations one by one as they occur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It must be said that
after three or four of what seem like complete insight cycles or
paths it can take quite a while to get a clear sense of what subtle
dualities remain. You might find yourself walking around for days to
months thinking, “Dang, I’ve really got it now. I’m just seeing
it no matter what happens. Cool! I might have cracked the thing!
Dude.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Give things time and
beware of assuming that you have attained to more than you have. It
is a <i>very</i> <i>common</i> and embarrassing problem, but those
who know this territory will understand. However, those who do not
know this territory may not be so forgiving, so beware of claiming a
specific level of realization, particularly final realization,
however you define it, until you have carefully checked things out
for a very long time. I would advise thinking along the lines of,
“Well, my working hypothesis is that it seems that I have achieved
whatever, but I will keep an open mind and be cautious in what I
say.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Use the descriptions
of realization that follow to give yourself a general sense of the
territory and what tends to need work and investigation. Avoid
whenever possible the traps mentioned above, but when you realize you
have fallen into them, which is ever so human and common, then accept
this, learn from it and laugh! Should you realize that you have
failed to heed this advice, that you have bought into some limited
definition of yourself as a realized being of some defined rank or
level despite the warnings, you can try to deny it for a while,
that’s OK. You can imagine that you are very sure you know “where
you are,” as that sort of artificial solidification of reality is
common enough. You can get pissed off at yourself, that’s normal.
You can beat yourself up if you think that it will help, though it
rarely does. You can get bitter, though such responses tend to wear
out their welcome. You can pump yourself up, dwelling on “your”
imagined or real successes, though this tends to ring hollow soon
enough. You can try to pretend you don’t care what stage or level
you have achieved, though eventually this gives itself away. However,
when you feel you are done with these things, accept, learn and
laugh! Repeat as necessary and then get back to investigating those
sensations.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5608_1179888903"></a><a name="30__MODELS_OF_THE_STAGES_OF_ENLI"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_86"></a>
30. MODELS OF THE STAGES OF ENLIGHTENMENT *</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Before I discuss the
various models, I should begin by saying that this is almost
certainly the most easily misconstrued chapter in this book. Further,
if you are a big fan of standard Buddhist dogma, I strongly recommend
that you stop reading this chapter now and skip to the conclusion of
this book. Seriously, I’m about to get quite irreverent again, but
in that irreverence are bits of wisdom that are hard to find so
explicitly stated elsewhere, so dismiss this chapter at your peril.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The temptation when
thinking about enlightenment is to come up with something defined
that you can imagine, such as a state or quality of being, and then
fixate on that ideal rather than doing the practices that lead to
freedom. It is absolutely guaranteed that anything you can imagine or
define as being enlightenment is a limited and incorrect view, but
these views are extremely tempting just the same and generally
continue to be very seductive even through the middle stages of
enlightenment. Every possible description of the potential effects of
realization is likely to feed into this unfortunate tendency.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, my distinct
preference <i>when</i> <i>practicing</i> is to assume that
enlightenment is completely impractical, produces no definable
changes, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the scopes of the
other trainings. This means that I take it as a working hypothesis
that it will not make me a better person in any way, create any
beneficial mental qualities, produce any states of happiness or
peace, and provide no additional clarity into any of the issues
surrounding how to live my ordinary life. I have experimented with
adopting other views and found that they nearly always get in the way
of my insight practices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A view so easily
becomes sacred, and thus the temptation is to not investigate the
sensations that make up thoughts about that view, but rather to
imitate the ideal expressed in the content of that view. This can
seem like practice in fundamental insight, but it is not. I realize
that I am not doing a good job of advertising enlightenment here,
particularly following my descriptions of the Dark Night. Good point.
My thesis is that those who must find it will, regardless of how it
is advertised. As to the rest, well, what can be said? Am I doing a
disservice by not selling it like nearly everyone else does? I don’t
think so. If you want grand advertisements for enlightenment, there
is a great stinking mountain of it there for you partake of, so I
hardly think that my bringing it down to earth is going to cause some
harmful deficiency of glitz in the great spiritual marketplace.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Bill Hamilton had a
lot of great one-liners, but my favorite concerned insight practices
and their fruits, of which he said, “Highly recommended, can’t
tell you why.” That is probably the safest and most accurate
advertisement for enlightenment that I have ever heard. There was a
famous old dead enlightened guy (whose name ironically eludes me at
the moment), who was known to have said, “I have gained absolutely
nothing through complete and unexcelled enlightenment.” A friend of
mine thinks it was the Buddha, and it may have been. Regardless, it
is traditional to advertise enlightenment in the negative in the
Buddhist tradition and many others, either stating what it is not or
stating what is lost at each stage, but it is so very tempting to
imagine that “freedom from suffering” will naturally translate in
to a permanent state of mental happiness or peace, and this can tempt
one to try to mimic that idealized state. That would be a
concentration practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Having said all of
that, the fact is that the models of the stages of enlightenment are
out there and available. Even when they are not explicitly mentioned,
they have an obvious influence on how people describe realization.
Thus, I have decided to try to work with them so that they might be
used in ways that are helpful rather than harmful. This is more
difficult than it may initially sound.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are days I
wish the words for awakening didn’t exist, the models had never
exited, and that the whole process was largely unknown to the
ordinary person so that it would be less mythologized and
aggrandized, thus making conversations about it much more normal and
less reaction-producing. I wish we could start over, strip away all
the strange cultural and mythical trappings, create simple, clear
terms, and move on with things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are other days
when I think that at least people know it might be possible, even if
most of what has been said about it is pretty fantasy-based. My
greatest dream is that the current generation of enlightened teachers
will go far out of their way to correct the descriptive errors and
false promises of the past and lay the groundwork for perpetuation of
these reforms despite the economic and social pressures to do
otherwise. One of the issues holding this back is that unfortunately
only a few have gone far enough to see how the vast majority of the
golden dreams of enlightenment do not hold up to reality testing.
Another is that putting one’s self on an artificial pedestal can be
rewarding in many ways. One way or another, the number of voices
trying to bring things back in line with what can actually be done is
small in comparison to the forces that want to make it into something
grand and thus largely unattainable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Before I get too far
into the details, I should explain that the most essential principle
I wish to drive home is that THIS IS IT, meaning that this moment
contains the truth. Any model that tries to drive a wedge between the
specifics of what is happening in your world right now and what
awakening entails needs to be considered with great skepticism. With
the simple exception of the fact of poorly perceiving the sensations
occurring now and habitually coming up with the illusion of a
separate, continuous individual, nearly all of the rest of the dreams
are problematic to some degree. This basic principle is essential to
practice, as it focuses things on the here and now, and also happens
to be true. Back to the complexities...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The mental models we
use when on the spiritual path can have a profound effect on our
journey and its outcome. Most spiritual practitioners have never
really done a hard-hitting look at their deepest beliefs about what
“enlightenment” means or what they imagine will be different when
they get enlightened. Many probably have subconscious ideals that may
have come from sources as diverse as cartoons, TV shows (Kung Fu
comes to mind), movies, legends, 60’s gurus, popular music, popular
magazines, and other aspects of popular culture in general. More
formal and traditional sources include the ancient texts and
traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Sufism, Kabbala (however
you spell it), Christianity, Western Mystical Traditions (Alchemy,
Theosophy, Golden Dawn related traditions, etc.), the ancient Greek
mystery schools (including the fragmentary writings of those like
Heraclites), and the non-aligned or ambiguously aligned teachers such
as Kabir, Khalil Gibran, J. Krishnamurti, and many others. Modern
fusion traditions, such as the various new versions of Buddhism and
other traditions that are present in the West, also have a wide range
of explicit and implied ideals about awakening. Plenty of people also
seem to take their own inborn higher ideals for themselves or others
that have arisen from sources hard to define and made these a part of
their working if usually poorly-defined models of enlightenment.
There is also a strong tradition in the West of believing that
enlightenment involves perfecting ourselves in some psychological
sense, though this is also prominent in certain Eastern and
traditional models as well in slightly different forms.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just about all of
these sources contain some aspects that may at times be useful and
other aspects that at times may be useless or even send people in the
wrong direction. The number of contradictions that can be found even
within each specific tradition on the subject is much larger than I
think most people imagine. For instance, those who attempt a
systematic review of the dogmas of enlightenment within the Pali
Canon will find themselves tangled in a mass of widely divergent
doctrines, myths, stories and ideals, and this is only one tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, to take on the
subject of the models of the stages of enlightenment is a daunting
task, but by breaking it down into simplified categories, some
discussion of this wide mass of dogma and half-truth is possible. I
will use both simple, broadly applicable models and also discuss
specific models that come from some of the traditions and try to
relate these to reality. In the end, relating them to reality is
essentially the practice, and that falls to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I consider this
attempt to be just one addition to an old tradition that attempts to
reform the dogma and bring it back in line with verifiable truths,
albeit one that is more specific and comprehensive than any that I
have found. Each new culture, place, time and situation seems to need
to do this again and again, as the forces within us and society that
work to promote models that are out of touch with the truth of things
are powerful and perennial, with money, power, fame, ideals of
endless bliss and pleasure, the enticing power of the ideals of
self-perfection and the pernicious inertia of tradition being chief
among them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In that same vein,
this chapter is very much a situation in which I claim a very high
level of realization, write as if what I have achieved is sufficient
authority to write a chapter such as this one, and then present it as
if this is a definitive text on the subject, sufficient to contradict
significant portions of 2,500 years of tradition and the teachings
and writings of countless previous and current commentators. While it
is hard from my current vantage point to not believe this to be true,
anyone with sense will read this chapter with appropriate skepticism,
and this, as I see it, is one of the strengths of properly applied
Buddhism and rational thought in general. The Buddha was forever
asking people to not take his word at face value, but instead to do
the experiment and see if they come to the same conclusions. I
recommend the same. If you are able to achieve something beyond what
I state is possible, more power to you, and please let me know how
you did it! I would feel real regret if I thought that this work had
hindered anyone from achieving their full human potential, and am
always looking for practices and concepts that are useful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here is a list of
the basic categories of models that I use, though most traditions
contain a mix of most or all of these. There are probably other
aspects of the dreams of enlightenment that I have failed to address,
but this list should cover most of the basic ones. I look at each of
these as representing some axis of development, and basically all of
them are good axes to work on regardless of what they have to do with
enlightenment. That said, from what I have already written, it will
not be hard to pick out my favorites:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Non-Duality Models:
those models having to do with eliminating or seeing through the
sense that there is a fundamentally separate or continuous
center-point, agent, watcher, doer, perceiver, subject, observer or
similar entity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Fundamental
Perceptual Models: those that have to do with directly perceiving
fundamental aspects of things as they are, including perceiving
emptiness, luminosity, impermanence, suffering, and other essential
aspects of sensations regardless of what those sensations are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Specific Perceptual
Models: those that involve being able to perceive more and more, or
all, of the specific sensations that make up experience with greater
and greater clarity at most or all times, and usually involve
perfected, continuous, panoramic mindfulness or concentration at
extremely high speed. Emotional Models: those that have to do with
perfecting or limiting the emotional range, usually involving
eliminating things like desire, greed, hatred, confusion, delusion,
and the like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Action Models: those
that have to do with perfecting or limiting the things we can and
can’t do in the ordinary sense, usually relating to always
following some specific code of morality or performing altruistic
actions, or that everything we say or do will be the exactly right
thing to have done in that situation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Powers Models: those
that have to do with gaining in abilities, either ordinary or
extraordinary (psychic powers).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Energetic Models:
those that have to do with having all the energy (Chi, Qi, Prana,
etc.) flowing through all the energy channels in the proper way, all
the Chakras spinning in the proper direction, perfecting our aura,
etc.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Specific Knowledge
Models: those that have to do with gaining conceptual knowledge of
facts and details about the specifics of reality, as contrasted with
the models that deal with perceiving fundamental aspects of reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Psychological
Models: those that have to do with becoming psychologically perfected
or eliminating psychological issues and problems, i.e. having no
“stuff” do deal with, no neuroses, no mental illnesses, perfect
personalities, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thought Models:
those that have to do with either limiting what thoughts can be
thought, enhancing what thoughts can be thought, or involve stopping
the process of thinking entirely.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">God Models: those
that involve perceiving or becoming one with God, or even becoming a
God yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Physical Models:
those that involve having or acquiring a perfected, hyper-healthy or
excellent physical body, such as having long earlobes, beautiful
eyes, a yoga-butt, or super-fast fists of steel.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Radiance Models:
those that involve having a presence that is remarkable in some way,
such as being charismatic or radiating love, wisdom or even light.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Karma Models: those
that involve being free of the laws of reality or causes that make
bad things to happen to people, and thus living a blessed, protected,
lucky, or disaster and illness-free life. Perpetual Bliss Models:
those models that say that enlightenment involves a continuous state
of happiness, bliss or joy, the corollary of this being a state that
is perpetually free from suffering. Related to this are models that
involve a perpetual state of jhanic or meditative absorption.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Immortality Models:
those that involve living forever, usually in an amazing place
(Heaven, Nirvana, Pure Land, etc.) or in an enhanced state of ability
(Angels, Bodhisattvas, Sorcerers, etc.).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Transcendence
Models: those models that state that one will be free from or somehow
above the travails of the world while yet being in the world, and
thus live in a state of transcendence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Extinction Models:
those that involve getting off of the Wheel of Suffering, the round
of rebirths, etc. and thus never being reborn again or even ceasing
to be at the moment of enlightenment, that is, the great “Poof!”
on the cushion, not to be confused with the more mundane atmospheric
consequences of a legume-based diet, as anyone who as been on a
vegetarian meditation retreat knows all too well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Love Models: those
that involve us loving everyone and/or everyone loving us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Unitive Models: that
you will become one with everything in some sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Social Models: that
you will somehow be accepted for what you may have attained, that you
have attained something when people think you have, and variants on
these themes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Like me, you have
probably run into most or all of these ideals of awakening in your
spiritual quest and probably within yourself at some point in time,
either consciously or unconsciously. Given all of these high ideals,
it is not surprising that we find the task of awakening daunting if
not preposterous. Imagine yourself as the universally-accepted
radiant immortal angel bodhisattva bright-eyed yoga-butt-having
all-loving one-with-the-universe endlessly mindful perfectly healthy
emotionally perfected psychologically pure endlessly altruistic
non-thinking desire-free psychic-superhero star-child of light, and
then notice how this image may be in some contrast with your current
life. If you are anything like me, you may notice a bit of a
discrepancy! I will take on each model, relate them to a few of the
traditions, and try to make sense of where these ideals came from. I
will also address which ones are realistic and which are just a bunch
of beautiful dreams that can either help you identify areas to work
on or really screw up your spiritual quest if you are not careful.
You will note that none of these models come from any formal
tradition. In order to relate them to the traditions, here is a list
of some models from Buddhism:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Four Path Model
from the Theravada, which involves becoming a stream-enterer, second
path, third path and then an arahat (however you spell it).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Five Path Model
from the Tibetans.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Ten Bodhisattva
Bhumis from the Tibetans.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The ideal of
Buddhahood from all the Buddhist traditions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Sudden and
Gradual Awakening schools of Zen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are other
models from other traditions (e.g. St. John of the Cross’ Ladder of
Love), and I have already mentioned these in the section on the
Progress of Insight. I’m not going to go into much detail about
them here, but when you are familiar with the models I am going to
discuss you should be able to make some sense of them.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5610_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_NON_DUALITY_MODEL"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_87"></a>
THE NON-DUALITY MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Non-Duality
Model is without doubt my favorite of them all. It essentially says
that the goal is to stop a process of identification that turns some
patterns of sensations into a Doer, Perceiver, Center Point, Soul,
Agent or Self in some very fundamental perceptual way. By seeing
these sensations as they are the process can gradually be seen
through until one day there are no more sensations that trick the
mind in this way. My favorite quote that articulates this model is
the one that goes something like, “In the seeing just the seen, in
the hearing just the heard, in the thinking just the thought,” and
thus I may repeat this quote a few times just to make the point of
how profound it is. Basically, there is just a field of sensations,
as there was before, but now all of these sensations are
progressively just seen to be as they are, and all the sensations
that we generally call “me” are just a part of this process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This model does not
imply anything else, promises nothing related to any other models
except in some loose way the Fundamental Perception Model that I will
talk about shortly. The Non-Duality Model 8 is the one of the most
practical models for practice, in that it focuses on simply seeing
things as they are right now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I will talk more
about this model as we go, and have already talked about it often in
a less direct way. I present it first to serve as a foil or
counterpoint to all of the other models, and it is the only model
that can withstand reality testing without qualification or
difficulty. All of the other models may contain some degree of truth
somewhere in them, either literally or poetically, but this one you
can hang your hat on all the way through. This awareness develops
gradually with some sharp jumps along the way, leading to the endless
debates about sudden and gradual schools of awakening, a subject that
will hopefully become more clear as we go, but probably deserves some
mention here.</p>

THE SUDDEN SCHOOLS OF AWAKENING</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are schools of
awakening, particularly some Zen (Chan) traditions from China and
Korea, and some interpretations of Hinduism, though this is not a
complete list, that say that awakening happens in one big shift and
that’s basically it, regardless of exactly how you define “it”.
They deny the claims of the progressive schools (Theravada, Tibetans,
some other strains of Zen, most schools of Sufism, Qabala, other
Western Traditions, etc.) that there is mappable territory before
awakening and that there might be lots to do after stream entry or
whatever you want to call it. Possible explanations for these schools
include:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. There may be a
few rare individuals that somehow manage to go straight to full
awakening due to whatever interesting way they are wired or
practiced, though I have never met anyone who did this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. There may be
schools founded or influenced by people who got to the first stage of
awakening and somehow never realized there could be anything more
than that or got trapped in a lie about being fully awakened when
they hadn’t yet realized there was more to go and never retracted
their initial, erroneous claim.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. There are people
who just thought that was the dogma somehow and stuck with it
regardless of any issues of actually having insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Other explanations I
haven’t thought of or run across. Being as every single person I
have ever known has followed a progressive path, including myself, it
is very hard for me to believe the sudden claims except for keeping
open the possibility that there may be the exceedingly rare
practitioner who occasionally manages to pull this off and thus
imagines based on their limited experience that this is how it
happens in general. In short, if you manage to do this, more power to
you, and please let me know. Otherwise, I would bet on the gradual,
progressive schools, and if you attain something that you are pretty
impressed by, give it time to see how it holds up when the troubles
of the world come knocking at your door over the months and years
after that shift of perspective.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5614_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_89"></a><a name="THE_FUNDAMENTAL_PERCEPTION_MODEL"></a>
THE FUNDAMENTAL PERCEPTION MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Related to the
Non-Duality Model, and also useful for practice, are the Fundamental
Perception Models. I say models here because various traditions
emphasize different qualities of reality as being essential. For
instance, the Theravada uses the Three Characteristics of
Impermanence, Suffering and No-Self, as you already know well by this
point. The Mahayana traditions (Tibetans in particular), may
emphasize Shunyata or emptiness, and the Vajrayana traditions may
emphasize luminosity or the space-like meditative equipoise of
Dzogchen. They may also talk about Maha Ati, or express fundamental
truths in some other way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These models may
directly state or imply that enlightenment involves continuously
perceiving these aspects of things in all sensations at a conscious
level, so that every waking instant we were flooded with the sense of
impermanence or luminosity or whatever as our dominant experience.
While attempting to perceive this at all times is excellent practice
advice, particularly when on retreat, were these models true then
realization would seem to involve flooding the consciousness of the
individual with a ton of information at all times. While there may be
moments or bursts of this sort of perception in enlightened
individuals, this is not what finally happens. Instead, with strong
awareness of how things are, a process of identification stops, the
switch is thrown, as noted above in the Non-Duality Models. By
following the practice advice of the Fundamental Perception Models we
may come to stop this process. However, as the Buddha said, do not
imagine that you must continue to carry the boat once you have
crossed the river. While enlightened individuals can at a whim notice
the true aspects of sensations, just as color is clear to a person
with good eyesight (assuming they are not color-blind), so these
things are clear to an enlightened being to various degrees as they
progress along the path. That said, just because one can perceive
something doesn’t mean that particular aspect is the dominant
aspect of consciousness at all times. In short, the Fundamental
Perception Models are very useful for practice, but do not quite
accurately describe the final result.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5616_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_90"></a><a name="THE_SPECIFIC_PERCEPTION_MODELS"></a>
THE SPECIFIC PERCEPTION MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Specific Perception
Models essentially state or imply that an enlightened being will be
constantly hyper-aware of every single sensation that arises in their
field of perception, including not just the ultimate aspects of the
Fundamental Perception Models, but also every single little detail of
the content of those sensations, achieving at all times the perfected
fusion of the completely open and panoramic perspective of High
Equanimity with the laser-like precision of the Arising and Passing
Away at its height. It implies that rather than stopping a process,
enlightenment is about becoming so fantastically alert that you see
not only the true nature but also the specifics of each and every
sensation that arises at all times. This is not even close to what
happens in reality. While enlightened beings will cycle through those
stages, when mindfulness is low each of those stages will present in
a low key way, and only for moments here and there will there be
anything like that kind of awareness, though when enlightened beings
are on retreat and/or really powering the mindfulness and
concentration they can temporarily achieve something that resembles
these high ideals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Specific
Perception Models are another instance where practice instructions
get turned into an ideal of what is supposed to happen in exactly the
same way as happens with the Fundamental Perception Models. They
become one more example of carrying the boat after we have crossed
the river. Again, mindfulness comes and goes, sleep comes and goes
(though the Tibetan teachings on dream yoga are very intriguing),
concentration comes and goes, various perspectives and perceptual
thresholds parade through, and the cycles of the ñanas continue on
and on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The ideals in this
model and many models that follow it are sometimes used as a weapon
by those who like to criticize those who rightly or wrongly claim to
be enlightened. Examples include, “Don’t you remember when I said
(such and such)?”, “Didn’t you notice how I cleaned the
bathroom?”, or “How could you have forgotten to pay the power
bill?” The implication inherent in each of these is that
enlightened being should have perfect awareness of all aspects of
their sensate reality as well as perfect memory of all of those
aspects. This ideal is unfortunately completely bogus. I so wanted to
be a Sensation Perceiving Superstar with a photographic memory and
have been sorely disappointed. As basically everyone out there has
some aspect of this model in their working definition of what
“enlightenment” must be, these ideals can be a particular problem
in relationships, particularly business relationships and romantic
ones for those who are out of the closet about enlightenment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In this basic vein,
this brings up another selling point of realistic, down-to-earth,
human models of what awakening brings. If you tell people you are
enlightened and also promote very high, idealized, delusional,
perfectionistic models of awakening, those who actually get to know
well will realize how full of shit you are, particularly people such
as spouses or partners, business associated, best friends and the
like. Further, the more you get stuck trying to be like the person
you dream you are supposed to be rather than who you are, the more
you can get isolated in your false and pretentious fantasy land,
locked away from the grounding, healing, and helpful reality testing
that comes from community and real, intimate human relationships.
However, if the Specific Perceptual Models are a problem in this way,
you haven’t seen anything until you get to the Emotional Models.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5618_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_91"></a><a name="THE_EMOTIONAL_MODELS"></a>
THE EMOTIONAL MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Emotional Models
are so fundamental to the standard ideals of awakening as to be
nearly universal in their tyranny. You can’t swing a dead cat in
the Great Spiritual Marketplace without hitting them. Almost every
tradition seems to have gone out of its way to promote them in the
most absurd and life-denying terms available, though there 2 have
been attempts at reform also. I must give thanks for the attempts,
however ineffective, bizarre, mythologized, cryptic, and vague, that
the Tibetan and Zen traditions have occasionally made in this regard,
and morn their nearly perpetual failure to make these issues clear.
At least they tried, whereas the Theravada basically has really not
tried in any significant way in 2,500 years so far as I can tell. If
I am wrong, please let me know.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These emotional
models basically claim that enlightenment involves some sort of
emotional perfection, either gradually or suddenly, and usually make
these dreams the primary criteria for their models of awakening and
often ignoring or sidelining issues relating to clear perception of
the true nature of phenomena. Usually these fantasies involves
elimination of the “negative” emotions, particularly greed,
hatred, anger, frustration, lust, jealousy, and sadness. At a more
fundamental level, they promise the elimination of all forms of
attraction and aversion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As I am sure you can
already tell, I am no fan of these models of enlightenment. In fact,
I consider their creation and perpetuation to be basically evil in
the good old “You Should Burn In Hell For Perpetuating Them” kind
of way, though as guidelines for trying to be kind and behave well
(training in morality) I find them of value. I know both what hints
of truth they contain and also what a marketing ploy they are, and
will attempt to make both aspects clear. This is not easy to do, and
the dogma of the Emotional Models is so deeply ingrained in us all
that shaking it can be the work of a lifetime even in enlightened
beings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The practical
application of making this distinction is based upon the fact that we
will try to realize the model we consciously or unconsciously adopt.
It is extremely tempting if we buy into the limited emotional range
models to go around imitating an emotionally limited state,
repressing or ignoring aspects of our basic human nature. There are
some benefits to repressing the manifestations of negative emotions
while simultaneously being conscious and accepting of the fact that
difficult emotions occur. However, if we repress them and also
pretend that they don’t exist, this sort of cultivated denial can
also produce huge shadow sides and a lot of neurotic behavior. A far
more practical approach is to accept that we are human, try to be
decent in a normal sort of way rather than in a grandiose spiritual
way, and to assume that reducing and eliminating the illusion of the
dualistic split is possible through doing basic insight practices.
Reducing the sense of a split can provide more clarity, allowing us
to be the human beings that we are with more balance and less
reactivity in the face of that humanity.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5620_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_92"></a><a name="THE_THERAVADA_FOUR_PATH_MODEL"></a>
THE THERAVADA FOUR PATH MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The root of the
problem in standard Buddhism comes to us from the Theravada Four Path
Model. This is the original model presented in the Pali Canon and the
oldest model we have to work with. All the subsequent schools
(Mahayana of various strains and the Vajrayana) react to it in their
way but are still influenced by it even if they say they are not, so
you need to know it to understand the debate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the
problems began long before in ancient Hinduism (which had a huge
impact on Buddhism, despite what some Buddhist will tell you) and
probably before that, but this is as good a place to start as any. I
shouldn’t blame ancient India for what is really a perennial human
wish. Let’s face it: we all want emotional perfection, as a large
chunk of the pain felt in modern life relates to people’s emotions
causing trouble. I will claim that not perceiving our emotions
clearly is a far greater problem than the emotions themselves, but I
am clearly in the minority in this regard. As I stated in the chapter
called Harnessing the Energy of the Defilements, there is a lot to be
said for aspects of what we usually consider the bad emotions. It is
important to realize that empty compassion underlies all our
emotions, whether filtered through the illusion of duality or
otherwise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Theravada Four
Path Model is a model involving four stages of awakening, namely
First Path or Stream Entry (Pali: sotapanna), Second Path or Once
Returner (sakadagami), Third Path or Never Returner (anagami) and
finally Fourth Path, Holy One, Saint, or Conqueror ( arahat, arhat,
arahant, or arhant, pick your favorite spelling). The terms Once
Returner and Never Returner have to do with issues relating to the
dogma that those who have attained to second path cannot be reborn
more than once before attaining arahatship, and certainly not in the
lower realms (hell realms, hungry ghost realms or animal realms), 4
and that those of third path, if they do not attain to arahatship in
this lifetime, will at worst be reborn into a heaven realm where the
conditions are optimal for achieving enlightenment. However, the core
of the Theravada Four Path Model is the dogma that enlightenment
involves progressively eliminating the Ten Defilements in the
following manner.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Stream Entry
eliminates the first three defilements: skeptical doubt, attachment
to rites and rituals, and personality belief. Second Path attenuates
the fourth and fifth defilements, usually translated as greed and
hatred or more technically as attraction and aversion to everything
that is not a jhanic state. Third Path is said to eliminate those
same fourth and fifth defilements however translated. Fourth Path,
that of arahatship, eliminates the remaining five defilements of
attachment to formed jhanas (the first four jhanas), attachment to
the formless realms (the second four jhanas), restlessness and worry,
“conceit” (in quotes because it is a bit hard to translate), and
something called “the last veil of unknowing”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is important to
note that arahats that are said to have “eliminated conceit” (in
limited emotional range terms) can appear absolutely arrogant and
conceited, as well as restless or worried, etc. That there is no
fundamental suffering in them while this is going on is an utterly
separate issue. That said, conceit in the conventional sense and the
rest of life can cause all sorts of conventional suffering for
arahats just as it can for everyone else. While I am on the subject
of conceit, perhaps I should take on the subject of the word “ego”
in a more comprehensive way than I have done so far.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The pop psychology
meaning of the word “ego” is something like arrogance, pride,
narcissism, and a failure to take into account the feelings, rights
and/or existence of others. This is also the definition that is the
most commonly behind such mainstream Buddhist statements as, “That
action or statement that I really didn’t like had a lot of ‘ego’
in it.” I think that this definition of ego can sometimes be
slightly useful for training in morality if we are very kind to
ourselves and those around us, but often it seems to me to be pop
spirituality turned into a weapon and a form of denial of someone
else’s difficulties, feeling and suffering. Worse, people often
take this definition, mix it in with their own insecurities and
unfortunate fear of existing or asserting themselves in the
conventional sense, and then take this neurotic mixture and use it to
continue to flog themselves and those around them. Please don’t do
this. It is misguided and will not help you or anyone. This pop
psychology definition of ego also has nothing to do with
enlightenment in the formal sense, and so don’t bring it to mind
when you read this chapter except to dismiss it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another definition
of ego is the formal psychological one put forward by Freud. In this
definition, ego is the moderator between the internalized parent or
police of the super-ego and the primal drives of the id, those being
largely for reproduction and survival. In this sense, ego is an
extremely good thing and should be cultivated consciously and without
restraint. This definition has to do with the more formal
psychological concept of “ego strength,” a strength that is very
positive and necessary for the deep and often difficult personal
growth that we all want for ourselves. One of the explicit
requirements for entering intensive psychoanalysis is high ego
strength, the ability to face one’s reality and dark stuff without
completely freaking out. Thus, eliminating this form of ego would be
a disaster.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For reasons
completely beyond me, the word “ego” is also used in a high
mystical sense to describe the elimination of the experiential
illusion of there being a special reference point as described in the
chapter on the Three Characteristics in the section on no-self. One
who had eliminated this form of ego, which is in this case a useless
illusion, might describe their experience in this way, “In this
full field of experience or manifestation, there seems to be no
special or permanent spot that is observing, controlling, separated
from, or subject to any other point or aspect of the rest of this
causal field of experience or manifestation.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is the
experience and realization of the arahat. Notice that this definition
of ego seems to have nothing whatsoever with the other definitions of
ego. This is exactly the point, and so I strongly advocate never
using the word ego in the context of describing realization or the
goal of the spiritual life, or at least not doing so without
extensive explanation of this particularly special and uncommon usage
of the term. Those who do otherwise continue to cause an astounding
amount of unrealistic, disempowering and life denying thinking in
mainstream Buddhists. It is my sincere wish that the misuse of the
word ego and its associated negative side effects stop immediately
and forever. Back to the models...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As the Theravada
Four Path Model explicitly states that realization is all about
eliminating greed, hatred, restlessness, worry, etc., this is as
explicitly a limited emotional range model, and, as expected,
deserves some serious skepticism. In fact, this is a good time to go
into what I love and despise about the Theravada. I absolutely love
their emphasis on the Three Characteristics, love the astounding
power of their techniques and am grateful beyond words for the maps
they provided me for the territory before stream entry, however
incomplete and idealized. I am profoundly grateful, at times to the
point of tears, and I mean that, for the monasteries I got to sit in,
for their preservation of that which is true and useful in Buddhism
for 2,500 years, and for the chance to have sat with real,
enlightened teachers because of their perseverance and work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And yet, their maps
of enlightenment still contain a hefty helping of scary market-driven
propaganda and so much garbage that is life-denying, dangerously out
of touch with what happens, and an impediment to practice for
millions of people. That the enlightened lineage holders of the
modern Theravada and their ex-monk Western counterparts don’t have
the balls to stand up and say, “We are deeply sorry that for 2,500
years our predecessors perpetuated this craziness to put food in
their bowls and fool ignorant peasants so that they might be
supported in their other useful work, and we vow to do better!” is
a crying shame.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They are chained to
the texts, myths and the ancient lies, seemingly doomed to
indoctrinate and brainwash generation after generation of monks,
practitioners and devoted followers with their delicious poison. What
a freakish paradox that the meditative techniques and technologies
that I consider among the most powerful and direct ever created
should come from a tradition whose models of awakening contain some
of the worst bullshit of them all. I have sat with numerous arahats
who were monks or former monks who just couldn’t seem to overcome
their indoctrination and so when giving dharma talks would habitually
mix in the crap with the gold when it was obvious they knew better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have at times
dreamed that all the teachers from all the lineages would get
together in secret, come up with a plan to jointly get themselves out
of the trap, and in a big formal ceremony present the truth as a new
beginning, like a mass intervention, like a family gathering around
an alcoholic to try to force them to reform their ways. None of them
on their own seem to be fully able to take the heat, as each one that
steps out of line in a direct fashion tends to get blasted, though
there are exceptions, such as Jack Kornfield’s <u>After</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Ecstasy</u>, <u>the</u>&nbsp; <u>Laundry</u>. Thus, I think they
should all try to do it together, with Zen Masters, Lamas, Rinpoches,
Tulkus, Sayadaws, Achaans, and their Western counterparts all
standing side by side saying, “Enough is enough! We are declaring a
new era of honest, open, realistic dharma teaching, free from
sectarian fighting, free from preposterous models of awakening, and
free from denial of humanity!” Enough of my ranting, back to the
models...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have no major beef
with their description of stream entry. It does make people realize
somewhat that rites and rituals are not the primary reason that they
got enlightened, though I know of a number of practitioners that got
enlightened with the help of techniques that were very ritualistic
and continue to include rituals of various sorts in their practice,
and why not. Stream entry does counter in some semi-intellectual way
the sense that there is a permanent, separate self, though exactly
how they know this is much more vague and mysterious to them than at
the higher stages of awakening, though it beats the pants of any
understanding of this that is pre-stream entry.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, they know
that awakening is possible and can be done in this lifetime, assuming
they know they are awakened in the first place, which strangely not
all enlightened beings do. Those persons that encounter these
understanding outside of established traditions may fail to recognize
that what they have understood is called awakening and other names.
Regardless, stream entry is known as the opening of the Dharma Eye,
as contrasted with the Wisdom Eye of arahatship. These are simply
poetic metaphors for some aspects of clearly perceiving things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My real problem with
the Theravada Four Path Model comes as soon as it starts talking
about second path, i.e. the attenuation of greed and hatred or
attraction and aversion, and by the time it promises eliminating
these in their ordinary forms as they say occurs in third path, I
think that serious critique of their language and dogma is called
for. What they are attempting to say is that the sense of the
observer, center point, continuous and separate subject, watcher or
however you want to describe the sense that there is some Self at the
center of all this stuff that so compelling seems to divided into
Self and Other is, in fact, just a bunch of sensations. When these
begin to be perceived as they are, the sense of how special the
center point is begins to lose its grip on perception, which begins
to become wider, more inclusive, and more even in its basic treatment
of phenomena. Thus, as there doesn’t seem to be so much of a this
side and a that side, attempts to get away from that side when it is
bad, get to that side when it is good, or just tune out to the whole
thing when it is boring diminish at some basic perceptual level, and
so the system functions better as it is better at realistically
interpreting the information coming into it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is a very tough
thing to talk about, and certainly doesn’t sell as well as saying,
“Do these things, and you will be free from all negative emotions,”
or worse, “We did these things and so are free from all negative
emotions, and so you should worship us, give us donations, support
our center, buy our books, give over power to us, think of us as very
special or amazing, stand in awe of us, sleep with us, allow us to
act like raving nutcases, etc.” I think you get the picture. Thus,
what happens in reality is that segments of the process of making
specific categories and patterns of the causal, sensate field into a
separate “self” is reduced and then stops. However, many of the
traditions advertise eliminating negative emotions and the sensations
of craving or aversion. The two couldn’t be more different, and yet
they are described as being the same.</p>

A REVISED FOUR PATH MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here is my revised
version of the Four Path Model, and this is the primary model I use
when describing awakening, talking about my 9 practice, and helping
others practice. I think that using the original terminology and
revising its definitions allows a lot of good material in the Pali
Canon to be used, thus provides a link to previously done work.
However, I realize that using terminology that already has such deep
cultural and dogmatic resonance may be a problem. For those who want
something new, I will shortly present a rephrasing of this model that
I call the Simple Model.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the Revised Four
Path Model, Stream Enterers have discovered the complete
discontinuity that is called Fruition and sometimes called Nirvana or
Nibbana (Sanskrit vs. Pali). This is the first of two meanings of
Nirvana, with the other being Fourth Path. Stream enterers cycle
through the ñanas, know that awakening or some different
understanding from the norm is possible, and yet they do not have all
that different an experience of most sensations from those who are
not yet stream enterers. They may correctly extrapolate a lot of good
dharma insights from momentary experiences, particularly high up in
High Equanimity and the three moments before a Fruition, but this is
not the same as living there all the time. In fact, most stream
enterers have a very hard time describing how things have changed in
terms of their daily life except that they cycle and can understand
the dharma in ways they never could before.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Those of Second Path
have now completed a new insight cycle. They understand the process
by which enlightened beings make further progress and equate progress
with further cycles of insight, which is partially true. More
model-obsessed or intellectual practitioners at second path may get
very into fractal models, consciousness models, enlightenment models,
various integrative theories, and that sort of thing at this stage of
practice. Psychological issues tend to be a bit more of a big deal
during this phase, and psychological development become interesting
to them in some way. By this point most people, though certainly not
everyone, also have a pretty good understanding of the basics of the
samatha jhanas, and these can be very fascinating. What they may be
most bothered by is that cycle after cycle of practice, duality
remains the predominant experience most of the time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Those of Third Path
have shifted their understanding of what progress is from those of
Second Path, and have begun to see that it is about perceiving the
emptiness, selflessness, impermanence, luminosity etc. of sensations
in daily life and begin to see that they have the ability to do this.
This can be a long, developmental process from the first time they
notice this to it becoming a nearly complete experience. Thus, Third
Path tends to be a long path, though it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">At the beginning of
Third Path, most practitioners think: “I’ll just complete more
cycles of insight, like I did before, and this will do the trick.”
They don’t tend to understand what it is they have attained all
that well yet, nor its deeper implications. By the mature stage of
Third Path, which can take months to years to show up, the
practitioner is more and more able to see the emptiness, selfless,
centerlessness, luminosity, etc. of phenomena in real-time, so much
so that it can be very difficult to notice what artificial perceptual
dualities remain.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As they cycle, they
will enter new territory, possibly causing some uncertainty or
instability, and with each Review phase they tend to really feel that
they have done it until they begin to notice the limits of their
practice. There can be this nagging something in the background that
things aren’t done, and yet figuring out exactly what the problem
is can be very slippery. It is a bit like being in the stages before
stream entry, trying to figure out what exactly needs to be done.
They need to notice something that has nothing to do with the cycles,
to finally untangle the knot of perception at its core, but doing
this can be a real trick. It is a very strange place, as one seems to
know the dharma all the way to the end and yet somehow it just isn’t
quite enough. In that vein, it is interesting to note that I wrote
the vast majority of this book while I was some sort of anagami, and
on reflection I got just about everything right. My emphases are
slightly different now, but the basics are all the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As things progress,
anagamis begin to tire of the cycles to a small or large degree and
begin to look to something outside of them or not related to them for
the answer to the final question. Finally, the cycles of insight, the
states of concentration, the powers, and all the other perks and
prerogatives of their stage of awakening or concentration abilities
(if they developed them) hold no appeal and only lead to more
unsatisfying cycles.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I completed around
27 full, complete insight cycles with mind-blowing A&amp;P Events,
Ass-kicking Dark Nights, Equanimity phases, and what seemed to be
brand new, fresh Fruitions and Review phases between third and fourth
path. There is nothing special about that number, both because it is
just a guess and because of the reasons I stated when describing the
phenomena of Twelfth Path. The later cycles got faster and faster, so
that by the end it seemed I was whipping one out every few weeks or
even every few days, but they still seemed to be leading nowhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It was only when I
had gotten so sick of the cycles and realized that they were leading
nowhere that I was able to see what has nothing to do with the
cycles, which also wasn’t anything except a strange untangling of
the knot of perception of them. The cycles, for better or worse, have
continued just the same. Thus, there is not much point in counting
cycles or paths, as they don’t necessarily correlate well with
anything past the first two or three, and issues of backsliding can
really make things complex, as I explained earlier.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Finishing up my
Revised Four Path Model, arahats have finally untangled the knot of
perception, dissolved the sense of the center point actually being
the center point, no longer fundamentally make a separate Self out of
the patterns of sensations that they used to, even though those same
patterns of sensations continue. This is a different understanding
from those of Third Path in some subtle way, and makes this path
about something that is beyond the paths. This is also poetically
called the opening of the Wisdom Eye. What is interesting is that I
could write about this stage quite well when I was an anagami, but
that is a whole different world from knowing it like arahats know it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Wisdom Eye may
seem to blink initially. It may go through cycles of flashing open
just after a Fruition and then slowly fading over a few hours (at
least on retreat) as each round of physical sensations, then mental
sensations, then complex emotional formations, then lastly
fundamental formations such as inquiry itself move through and become
integrated into this new, correct and direct perception of reality as
it is. Review cycles may occur many times during each flash, but when
the eye is open they seem rather irrelevant in comparison to keeping
the level of clarity and acceptance high enough to keep the eye open.
When the eye fades and the knot of perception seems to retie itself,
the familiar insight cycles may seem like pure drudgery, with the
focus drifting back to getting lost in the cycles and then gradually
shifting again to getting clear enough to get the eye to open again.
The themes that occupy center stage go through a cycle that is very
much like a progress cycle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Finally, the Wisdom
Eye cycles and insight cycles all converge, and the thing stays open
from then on, which is to say that at that point it all seems the
same whether or not the eye is open, which it actually was. That
being seen, nothing can erode or disturb the centerlessness of
perspective. Done is what is to be done, and life goes on. That there
are arahats who have opened the Wisdom Eye but had it fade and those
who have opened it and had it stay open is rarely mentioned but worth
knowing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For the arahat who
has kept the thing open, there is nothing more to be gained on the
ultimate front from insight practices, as “done is what is to be
done”. That said, insight practices can still be of great benefit
to them for a whole host of reasons, there is a ton they can learn
just like everyone else about everything else there is to learn. They
can grow, develop, change, work and participate in this strange human
drama just like everyone else. Practicing being mindful and the rest
still helps. They also cycle through the stages of insight, as with
everyone above stream entry, so doing insight practices can move
those cycles along.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5624_1179888903"></a><a name="A_SIMPLE_MODEL"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_94"></a>
A SIMPLE MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In earlier versions
of this work, I had a model called The Heart Sutra Model. The Simple
Model is the less mysterious, stripped down version of that earlier
model, though in its essence it is the same. While in one sense it is
also rephrasing of the Revised Four Path Model, as it has no numbers,
and is free of the traditional names, it has some advantages over
that terminology.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I present this
somewhat novel model here because it focuses on real insight directly
and treats any emotional benefits of this as side effects. Further,
there are often too many cycles of insight before arahatship, making
the Four Path model troublesome. This phenomena of too many cycles
(which I will sometimes call “paths” with a lowercase “p”)
between each of the Four Paths gets worse as one works towards final
awakening. As Bill Hamilton put it, and I have learned the hard way,
“The arahat fractal is vast.” The Simple Model does not reinforce
fascination with content, nor with life denying ideals or limited
emotional range models in the way that the traditional Four Path
Model often does. It does not tempt one to count paths. It keeps the
focus on precise inquiry into the truth and one’s experience of it
or lack thereof.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This model basically
says that enlightenment is about direct insight that progressively
reveals something different in the relationship to the field of
experience and gradually allows things in it to be held in their
proper proportion. Thus, it is a Non-Duality Model.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first
understanding is that sensations are sensations, thoughts are
thoughts, and this forms the basis of further inquiry. When the
universal characteristics of these sensations begin to be seen, this
represents growth in understanding. When the whole sense field is
known directly and completely as it is, this can cause an entrance
into Fruition through one of the Three Doors, and represents the
first stage of awakening.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When one appreciates
the cycles of the process of awakening and has completed at least one
more new progress cycle, this is the next stage. When one begins to
appreciate the emptiness, luminosity, centerlessness, agentlessness,
etc. of phenomena in real-time and this becomes the focus of practice
rather than Fruition, this is the next stage. When the sense of the
watcher, observer, subject, controller, doer, etc. is seen completely
as it is and the knot of perception untangles, that simple,
fundamental way of perceiving things is the next stage of awakening.
When that untangling stays untangled, that is the next stage. As that
understanding is integrated into our lives, that is the next phase,
though it is more an ongoing process than a stage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The problem is that
the traditions seem to want to make this understanding into so much
more than it is, such as add ideals of emotional perfection onto
this. There is some truth in the models dealing with emotions, but it
has to do with things moving through faster and being seen more
clearly. It does not have anything to do with bad emotions not
arising. I hate to even go here, as my goal is to give the emotional
models the bashing they richly deserve, but I also want to not throw
the baby out with the bathwater. Thus, here it goes. As the
deep-seated perceptual sense of a separate, continuous, permanent,
observing Agent stops being extrapolated from the same old patterns
of sensations that seemed to be those, there is this wider inclusive
something that can come into the consciousness of the enlightened
individual, depending on their level of awakening. There is also a
slowly growing directness of perception that comes as reality is not
filtered so exclusively through thought. These two can combine to
give the emotions of enlightened beings less sticking power, so that
they may move through more quickly than for those that are not
enlightened, and also may be seen more quickly and clearly as they
arise and vanish. There may also be less blind contraction into
thoughts and emotions and a wider perspective, thus giving the other
parts of the brain more of a chance of creating moderated responses
to the emotions. That said, even when seen through, there seems to be
a biological component to how emotions move through that can only be
expedited so much.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Anyone who thinks
these highly qualified statements are anything like a vision of
emotional perfection or the elimination of all negative emotions is
not paying attention! That is the last thing I wish to imply. I
merely wish to say that there is some increased clarity about our
basic human experience and it can help, but that is all. That said,
you would be amazed how angry, lustful or ignorant enlightened beings
can be, and they can still do all sorts of stupid things based on
these emotions, just like everyone else. The ability to moderate
responses to emotions can sometimes give the impression that those
emotions have been attenuated, but that is not the same thing, and
there is my nice transition to the Action Models.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5626_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_ACTION_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_95"></a>
THE ACTION MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Action Models
tend to involve certain actions that enlightened beings cannot commit
or certain actions they must commit. Both types of models are
completely ridiculous, and so we come now to the first of the models
that simply has no basis in reality. The traditional Theravada models
contain numerous statements about what enlightened being cannot do or
will do that are simply wrong. My favorite examples of this insanity
include statements that arahats cannot break the precepts (including
killing, lying, stealing, having sex, doing drugs or drinking),
cannot have erections, cannot have jobs, cannot be married, and
cannot 5 say they are arahats. They also state that unordained
arahats must/will join the Theravada monastic order within 7 days of
their realization or they will die. Needless to say, all are simply
absurd lies, lies that have unfortunately often been perpetuated by
arahats.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is also
another more subtle and seductive view, and this is that enlightened
being somehow will act in a way that is better or higher, though they
won’t define what those actions might be or what actions they might
avoid. I consider this view very dangerous. While I wish to promote
the shift in perception that I call awakening and other names, I
don’t want to make out that somehow this will save anyone from
stupid actions or make them somehow always know how to do the right
thing or avoid screwing up. Such views are a setup for massive
badness and huge shadow sides, as anyone who has spent enough time in
a spiritual community knows all too well. As Zen says, “The bigger
the front, the bigger the back.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The list of highly
enlightened individuals who have bitten the proverbial dust by
putting themselves up on high, screwing up and then being exposed as
actually being human is remarkably long, and the list of spiritual
aspirants who have failed to draw the proper conclusions about
reality from the failures of the enlightened is even longer. There
are many schools of thought on this issue, and I will give them
formal names here, though in reality they don’t think of themselves
this way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Halfway Up the
Mountain School essentially believes, “Those who screwed up and
caused a scandal were only part way up the mountain, only partially
enlightened, as anyone who was really enlightened couldn’t possibly
have done those terrible things.” While clearly some were only
partially enlightened, or perhaps not enlightened at all in the
technical sense, a number of those who screwed up clearly knew
ultimate reality inside and out, and so this model misses many
important points.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is the Crazy
Wisdom School that believes, “Enlightened beings transcend ordinary
reality and with it ordinary morality, so that they are the natural
manifestation of a Wisdom that seems crazy to us foolish mortals but
is really a higher teaching in disguise!” While not entirely
absurd, as there are many cultural aspects and societal rules that
can seem a bit childish, artificial, unnecessary, unhelpful or naive
in the face of realization, the Crazy Wisdom School provides too easy
an excuse for plenty of behavior that has been and is just plain bad,
irresponsible, stupid and needlessly destructive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then there is my
school, for which I don’t have a catchy name, and it promotes the
view that, “Enlightened beings are human, and unfortunately humans,
enlightened or otherwise, all screw up sometimes. There is nothing
special or profound about this.” In short, my school categorically
rejects the specific lists and dogmas of the traditional Action
Models in all forms, from the preposterous lists of the Theravada to
the subtle sense that enlightened beings somehow are guaranteed to
perpetually act in “enlightened” ways, whatever those are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That said, the
ability to see things as they are does allow for the possibility of
more moderated responses to situations and emotions, as stated
earlier. That is a very different sort of a concept from coming up
with a list of things that enlightened being never would or could do,
and it certainly doesn’t mean they will necessarily act the way we
think they will. Further, while this is not an exhaustive list, the
behavior of any being is always affected by the following:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The standard
laws of the natural world</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The limits of
their level of realization</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The ingrained
habits of the realized individual, including their personality quirks
and “stuff”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The residue of
the shadow sides of the techniques and traditions they used to attain
their understanding (don’t underestimate these!)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The fact that
mindfulness waxes and wanes (at least in arahats and below and in all
realistic definitions of buddhas)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The fact that
confusion and stupidity can still occur exactly as before</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The limits of
the relative knowledge and experiences of the realized individual</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">– The
psychological and physiological issues that apply to the brain and
body of the realized individual</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Their cultural
upbringing and the relative mores created by it. You will notice that
this is quite a realistic and long list. Thus, the dogmas of the
standard action models, while containing a few grains of truth, are
simply wildly inaccurate, and generally represent some of the worst
of the models of enlightenment. A closely related issue is the
tensions between the “technically enlightened” models and the
limited possible action models. There are schools of thought that
say, “One enlightened action and one is a Buddha, one deluded
action and one is an ordinary human being.” These have their value
from a certain behavioral point of view, and can serve as a valuable
reminder to all that conventional morality tends to be an extremely
good idea most of the time. I, for one, think that everyone,
regardless of purported realizations or a lack thereof, should be
held to a high and fairly traditional moral standard, though in some
human, just, and forgiving way. However, teachings based on some
arbitrary ideal called “enlightened action” can begin to diminish
the importance of direct realization of the truth of things and
reinforce the mythical garbage of the limited possible action models
of realization.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are people who
are “technically” unenlightened (meaning that they have never
completed even one progress of insight or attained to any direct
understanding of emptiness or non-duality) who nonetheless live lives
that would be considered unremittingly saintly by even the very
highest standards. I have been fortunate enough to have met a few of
these people and continue to stand in awe of them. Just so, there are
those who are “technically” very highly enlightened, perhaps even
arahats or buddhas, who nonetheless can appear exceedingly ordinary,
seem to be of distinctly questionable moral virtue, or even sometimes
be downright debauched and outrageous. I have met a good number of
these also.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While the failure of
the limited or enlightened actions models and limited emotional
models is a huge disappointment from one point of view, it also means
that there is hope for the rest of us. Our lives are it, our emotions
are it, our habits are it, our limitations are it, our neuroses are
it, our issues are it, and our shadow sides are it. How can we attain
understanding if we do not see clearly into reality as it is? How can
we see clearly into reality as it is if we spend most of our time
thinking that it isn’t good enough to even examine clearly?</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5628_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_96"></a><a name="THE_POWER_MODELS"></a>
THE POWER MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On a rather
different tangent, enlightened beings are often believed to have
various kinds of powers, typically extraordinary ones, and thus we
have the Power Models. The converse of this is the belief that 8
people who have extraordinary powers might be or must be enlightened.
However, the relationship between the powers and fundamental insight
are slim, though not non-existent. Psychic powers come out of samatha
or concentration practices, particularly the fourth samatha jhana,
though they also may arise in the stages of the Arising and Passing
Away, High Equanimity, and sometimes in other stages and states as
well. Some people just seem to have them regardless of their
concentration or insight abilities. If you didn’t read the section
on the Psychic Powers in the chapter on the Samatha Jhanas, please do
so now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Note, nearly all of
the states and stages where the powers arise can be attained by
beings who have not yet reached the first stage of awakening, and so
we can see that there is no clear connection between nearly all of
the powers and awakening. The short-list of powers that are the
exclusive domain of the enlightened are attaining to Fruitions,
attaining Nirodha Samapatti (a deep state described in the Appendix),
and being able to talk about the dharma from their own direct
experience of it. There are some other things to be said about how
the stages of realization make a few other things available, but this
is a subtle, complex topic that I may take on at some later time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is true that
along the way to awakening it is hard to avoid chancing into all
sorts of experiences that are described in the standard lists of the
powers, and it is also much easier to develop the samatha jhanas when
you are in the Review phase of a path than it is if you are not
enlightened. However, developing those into powers that can be
attained again and again is a completely different matter and still
unrelated to enlightenment except on this one front: there is
something about the direct perception of the interconnection of
things that does lend a certain something to utilization and
development of the powers. Thus, we see some hint of why there are
these models of awakening. However, as stated above, these are
associations and nothing more. In summary, just because someone has
powers doesn’t mean they are enlightened, and just because someone
is enlightened doesn’t mean they will have any psychic powers that
are not directly related to their clear perception of things.

THE TIBETAN TEN BHUMI MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is probably a
good time to introduce the Tibetan Ten Bodhisattva Bhumi Model. The
word “bhumi” mean ground, or something like level. It is a model
of progressive stages of enlightenment that gets very different
emphases depending on the author, but one of those emphases has to do
with powers and how many duplicates of one’s self one can manifest
psychically. I actually like the Bhumi model, as other takes on it
have to do with giving up the notion of personal territory and
realizing shunyata or emptiness and deeply integrating that into our
perception, paradigm, practice, and personality. It is a model that
addresses many fronts, only one of which unfortunately is the powers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The details of the
Ten Bhumi Model can be found in various Mahayana texts, such as “The
Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom” and “The Jewel Ornament of
Liberation”. Chogyam Trungpa gives a nice description of it in <u>The</u>
<u>Myth</u> <u>of</u> <u>Freedom</u>. Some texts also list other
numbers of bhumis, such as 7 or 13, but they all share similar
elements. I do not consider myself an expert on this model, though I
do understand the territory it covers. It is a very complex model
that ascribes a wide range of exceedingly high and complex criteria
involving emotions, paradigms, concentration abilities, perceptions,
psychic powers and a whole host of other aspects to those of each
stage. Thus, from my point of view, it is fraught with problems and
assumes simultaneous, synchronized development on numerous axes, a
notion I consider a bit naïve and idealized. However, like most of
the teachings, it contains some very interesting points made in what
I consider very unfortunate ways. Thus, I recommend you check it out
<i>cum</i> <i>grano</i> <i>salis</i>, particularly if you want to
understand Tibetan texts or do practices in that tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Lining the model of
the Bhumis up with the Four Paths also involves some controversy.
That the first bhumi is stream entry is straightforward. Beyond that,
things get difficult. At points I have lined anagamihood up with
anywhere from the 4th to the 7th bhumis and arahatship with anywhere
from the 6th to 10th bhumis. These are not perfect correlations, and
if you spend some time reading about the model you will see why. I
recommend that you check out the sources listed above if you are
interested in further information about the Bhumis.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The biggest problem
with this model is that it delineates the number of duplicates of
one's self that one should be able to manifest as bodhisattvas at
each bhumi, and as the bhumis progress the numbers quickly get so
large as to be absurd. Why some whackjob included this bizarre ideal
of many-fold bi-location in the model I have no idea, but somehow no
Tibetan since has had the balls to throw it out, and so a thousand
years later they are still stuck with it. Aside from these problems,
the texts that describe the bhumis makes for very interesting
reading, particularly in the middle stages of enlightenment.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5632_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_TIBETAN_FIVE_PATH_MODEL"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_98"></a>
THE TIBETAN FIVE PATH MODEL</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While I am on the
subject of the Tibetan Models, I will present the Tibetan Five Path
Model. In this model, the details of which can be found in various
places, such as Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche’s book <u>Dharma</u> <u>Paths</u>
on Snow Lion. As that book does such a good job of explaining the
dogma and is not expensive, I will give only a brief treatment of
that model here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First Path covers
the territory from just beginning through the Arising and Passing
Away, and is called the Path of Accumulation. In the territory of
First Path, one accumulates direct insight into the true nature of
sensations by direct investigation of impermanence and the selfless
nature of phenomena, as one does in the first four ñanas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Second Path, that of
Unification, encompasses the territory from the Arising and Passing
Away, through the Dark Night, to High Equanimity and the first taste
of Stream Entry. These are perfect correlations also, and thus have
already been described. Third Path is the Path of Seeing, and
encompasses Stream Entry, and then begins the Fourth Path, that of
Meditation, which encompasses the rest of the Ten Bhumis. Third Path
is described as a plane taking off, and Fourth Path as it flying
higher and higher. Fifth Path is that of Buddhahood. As you can see,
the Five Path Model does not really add anything to the other models,
but knowing it will help you understand the correlations between the
terminology when you are trying to cross over between the writings
and oral teachings of various traditions. Back to the generic
models...

THE ENERGETIC MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In nearly the same
vein as the Power Models are the Energetic Models. They tend to
involve ideals that imply that enlightened beings will have all their
energy channels clear, their chakras or energy centers all the right
shape and color and all spinning in the correct direction, their aura
large, regular, and some nice color such as white, gold or violet,
and in general have perfected their energetic system, regardless of
the particular energetic system model being used. The simple fact of
multiple models and visions of what a perfected system should look
like is already a red flag for anyone paying attention, as the
various traditions can't even agree on how many chakras there are,
much less the rest of the details. I have noticed that these things
are very scriptable, meaning that one’s concepts of what is
supposed to be happening can influence what one perceives in these
areas. These models also leave much to be desired, and generally are
referring to things that happen in the A&amp;P and the fourth jhana,
as are the powers models.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Kundalini phenomena,
where all the energy (prana, lung or chi) blasts through the central
channel (shushumna), are very common in the A&amp;P Event. Some
traditions associate this event with awakening, though I consider
this erroneous and premature, though I can understand why these
stages impress people so much. It is during the A&amp;P that some
practitioners with a bent or talent for doing so may perceive energy
channels, sometimes in outrageous detail, and be able to see chakras
and the like. However, anyone who can do this in a sustained fashion
will note the following: that in the Dark Night the channels are a
mess in most people, and that in High Equanimity the focus shifts to
experience itself, not nearly so much what is in that field of
experience, and thus the channels can be difficult to perceive or a
secondary background aspect of what is going on. Further, enlightened
beings cycle all the time, their moods and health and other factors
change all the time, and so what their channels are doing and how
they perceive them will change all the time, leading to nothing
resembling the stable, clean, orderly, perfected, predictable
energetic state promised in the energetic models.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, the energetic
models are another example of a transient side effect of some
people’s practice being incorporated into an ideal of awakening.
While energetic practices are very interesting and may lead to lots
of insights and other nice effects, that is not the same thing as
enlightened being having stable, perfected energetic systems. My
friend Kenneth has asked me to add that there is something good that
progressively awakening does to the channels and energetic system,
and I have to agree. However, defining exactly what positive changes
are made is difficult, and none of the models I have seen really do
an adequate job or contain enough flexibility to accommodate how
dynamic our energetic systems are. Suffice to say, this is one more
set of models that is getting at something but contains much that
needs revision.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5636_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_SPECIFIC_KNOWLEDGE_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_100"></a>
THE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Specific Knowledge
Models basically state or imply that enlightenment will somehow
magically provide hidden conceptual information about all sorts of
specific things in life, such as the workings of particle physics,
how to bring about world peace, who one’s disciples should marry,
and the like. Some go further and state that enlightenment
progressively brings complete omniscience, meaning the ability to
know everything about the whole universe simultaneously. While these
might seem to some people like reasonable things enlightened beings
should somehow know, let’s include other things it might be good to
know, such as how to create safe, inexpensive lithium ion batteries
for electric cars, how to consistently beat the return of an S&amp;P
500 index fund over the long haul, how to balance the federal deficit
while providing everyone with good social support but not raising
taxes, how to instantaneously make every blue-collar Republican
realize that they are voting against their own self-interest, and how
to build a fusion reactor that is safe, inexpensive, produces enough
energy for everyone, and has no radioactive disposal issues. When you
look at these, the concept of specific knowledge gained by merely
seeing the true nature of ordinary sensations begins to seem as
ridiculous as it really is.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The only specific
thing I did gain a little insight into was the beauty of differential
equations that discuss the oscillation from the imaginary quantities
(potential) to real quantities (manifestation), but that’s about
it. Other than a bunch of direct knowledge of how the mind works and
3 a whole lot of knowledge about what a load of crap most religious
and mystical dogma is, and that includes Buddhist Dogma, I didn’t
really get any specific knowledge of anything else. So much for that
idea...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5638_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_101"></a><a name="THE_PSYCHOLOGICAL_MODELS"></a>
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here is another
thing that didn’t happen: psychological perfection. While the
mainstream Western Buddhist world is absolutely drowning in notion
that somehow Buddhist practice will either eliminate all their
psychological “stuff” or cause them to become self-actualized in
the good old psychoanalytical sense, nothing could be further from
the truth except perhaps the Action Models. I think that I learned
more about reasonable psychological health from reading one book on
Transactional Analysis (Vann Joines’ <u>TA</u> <u>Today</u>) than I
did from over a decade of highly successful Buddhist meditation. That
doesn’t mean that I have achieved perfect psychological health, not
by a long shot!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Focusing on
psychological growth is an epidemic disease in Western insight
practice. Many of the major retreat centers that purport to foster
insight practice in the US and Europe are actually bastions of the
worst pop psychological bullshit retrofitted with a bastardized
Buddhist front. You have only to go to a few small group meetings on
retreats, as I mentioned in Part II, to hear that the vast majority
of people who are supposed to be doing insight practices are actually
just wallowing in their own neurotic crap. Sure, they may be highly
intelligent, super sophisticated, fantastically well-rationalized,
pseudo-Buddhist practitioners of the Great Sacred Neurotic Crap
Wallow, but they are wallowing just the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As I mentioned
before, that this sort of behavior is tolerated on meditation
retreats at all is mind-boggling, but that it gets reinforced and
rewarded as often as it does is a crying shame that reflects as badly
on the teachers as it does the practitioners. I have had insight
teacher after insight teacher try to focus on what I was feeling and
how my relationships were going when all I wanted to do was talk
about my attempts at insight practices, as I assumed, often wrongly,
that they were insight teachers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While the dharma is
vast, and the teachings of the wisdom traditions contain a lot of
material for helping grow psychologically, that doesn’t mean that
it has anything to do with awakening or insight practice at all, 4
and letting people get stuck there does them little service, if you
ask me, which you clearly did, as you are reading this book. Again,
as I said before, working on one’s psychological stuff can have its
value, but I firmly believe that keeping the line between insight
practice and psychological work drawn as firmly as possible is
essential to doing either well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, it is oh so
easy to imagine that the teachers on the front cushion couldn’t
possibly be as neurotic as we are, and before you know it we have the
breeding ground for massive shadow sides, exploitation, isolation,
and scandal just like we had with the models that purport emotional
perfection. The Jet Set culture of teachers popping in, getting up on
the front cushion, spouting their beautiful ideals, and jetting off
to somewhere else before anyone can see them as the humans they
really are only goes to reinforce these dangerous notions. It is just
so easy to project all kinds of wondrous qualities on to them when
the dream is so nicely laid out and the opportunities for reality
testing so few. Clearly, that suits most of them just fine, or they
would go more out of their way to counter those notions, but, as they
quickly learn, countering those notions just doesn’t sell, and
getting caught up in that sort of transference feels mighty friggin’
nice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, I think that
the models that reinforce the notion that psychological perfection or
freedom from our psychological stuff will come simply by seeing
through the sense of a separate, permanent agent are a serious
problem for these major reasons:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. They simply
aren’t true.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. They cause
practitioners to get caught up in their stuff rather than focusing on
the Three Characteristics or something equivalent, thus squandering
the vast majority of Western Buddhist practitioner’s scant retreat
and practice time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. They allow
teachers to be able to ride the hot air of these preposterous ideals
to dangerous heights.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">4. They contribute
to the erroneous sense of the gap between this ordinary, human
existence and awakening by creating unrealistic ideals and goals.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">5. Most Buddhist
practitioners that I know have something like one of the following
belief structures: That awakening is impossible, so the best thing to
try for is psychological or emotional health or perfection.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">6. That awakening is
psychological or emotional perfection, so by trying for psychological
or emotional perfection one is doing the practices that lead to
awakening.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">7. That awakening
involves psychological or emotional perfection, so it clearly is
impossible, and by sitting they are trying to accomplish something
else, but if you ask them what that is they are usually unable to
answer clearly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What is so ironic is
that awakening is hard but clearly not impossible, and not nearly as
impossible as achieving psychological or emotional perfection. In
fact, seeing sensations clearly enough to see that they are all just
happening and coming and going is extremely straightforward once you
finally realize that is what you are supposed to be doing. Further,
when I think back on all the things I have done, including going to
medical school, spending a year in India working as a volunteer
there, and finishing a medical residency, I must say that the work I
went through to get those things was significantly more than the work
it took to get to stream entry and even arahatship. It is not that
getting stream entry was easy, just not as hard as plenty of other
things I have done. I attribute my success to a vast array of
factors, but two that are relevant here are a tolerance for pain and
having a good working model. That model was one that was blissfully
free of the notion of emotional or psychological perfection.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When I think about
what it would take to achieve freedom from all psychological stuff,
the response that comes is this: life is about stuff. Stuff is part
of being alive. There is no way out of this while you are still
living. There will be confusion, pain, miscommunication,
misinterpretation, maladaptive patterns of behavior, unhelpful
emotional reactions, weird personality traits, neurosis and possibly
much worse. There will be power plays, twisted psychological games,
people with major personality disorders (which may include you), and
craziness. The injuries continue right along with the healing and
eventually the injuries win and we die. This is a fundamental
teaching of the Buddha. I wish the whole Western Buddhist World would
just get over this notion that these practices are all about getting
to our Happy Place where nothing can ever hurt us or make us neurotic
and move on to actually mastering real Buddhist practice rather than
chasing some ideal that will never appear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">All that said, there
is some debate about what factors or progress allows some people to
just notice the Three Characteristics of the sensations that make up
their world in the fact of their stuff as opposed to those who just
flounder in their stuff. Some would argue that you have to have done
enough psychological work and deal with enough of your issues to get
to the place were you can move on to the next stage. I must
reluctantly admit that there is probably some truth to this. However,
I didn’t consider myself particularly psychologically advanced when
I started insight practices, as I had all kinds of stuff to deal with
and still do, and yet somehow, perhaps through good instruction,
perhaps through some other factors I have yet to identify, I was able
to practice well despite it all and make the shift from being lost in
content to noticing how things actually are.</p>

THE THOUGHT MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Speaking screwed up
models, we have the Thought Models. These are models that tend to
focus on something different happening with thoughts in those who are
awakened, rather than simply seeing through the thought patterns that
create a sense of a center point or special, permanent, separate
self. These idealized models include not thinking certain thoughts,
such as enlightened beings being unable to think the thought “I”
or “I am”, not thinking at all and thus stopping the process of
thought, or some other modification to thoughts, such always thinking
good thoughts, whatever those are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I got an email a
while ago from a seemingly nice engineer who said basically: “I did
some Taoist practices, got enlightened, and now am incapable of
thinking any thoughts or visualizing, yet I seem to function
normally. What do you think of this?” I put a lot of thought into
my response, and so am including it here, in slightly edited form:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. “One of my dead
teachers, Bill Hamilton, used to talk about how people's conceptions
of what was supposed to happen would have some influence on
subsequent events, with some question about what that influence was.
We used to discuss this often, with possibilities including: People
with different models of awakening might actually achieve different
results. I am no fan of this proposition but admit the possibility.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. People with
different models might achieve the same thing but describe it
differently. I believe this one more than the first.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. Some combination
of these.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">4. People might fail
to achieve results but be scripted to report or believe that they had
achieved something in line with their own working model. This is a
common occurrence, one that I have observed in myself more times than
I can count and also in the practice of many other fellow dharma
adventurers. Bill would often mention people's ability to self
hypnotize into semi-fixed states of delusion. He had a long run of
hanging out in scary cult-like situations with psychopathic teachers
and got to observe this first hand in himself and others: see his
book <u>Saints</u> <u>and</u> <u>Psychopaths</u> for more on this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">5. People with
different models and techniques might have very different experiences
of the path along its way: this is clearly true in some aspects, and
yet the universal aspects of the path continue to impress me with
their consistency and reproducibility regardless of tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">6. Other
possibilities we hadn't considered, in the style of Donald Rumsfeld’s
famous Unknown Unknowns...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The “no thought”
question is an interesting one. It is commonly used in some
traditions as being the goal, these including some strains and
descriptions of Hindu Vedanta, multiple non-aligned traditions, and
others. Zen sometimes toys with the idea on its periphery. As to
Taoism: I did a bunch of reading of the old Taoist masters some years
ago, but I wouldn't consider myself an expert on it's current
practice or dogma.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Buddhism does not
generally consider not thinking or not being able to visualize among
its goals, which brings us to the points mentioned above. For
instance, the Awakened Buddha often says things in the old texts
like, &quot;It occurred to me that I should wander by stages to [such
and such a place].&quot; Or, &quot;This spontaneous stanza, never
heard before, occurred to me.&quot; These obviously are thoughts.
Furthermore, if we note the old texts as reference, all of the
enlightened disciples of the Buddha and the Buddha himself were
described as thinking thoughts. Further, many of the Buddha's
disciples could visualize, as could the Buddha, and if we look to
modern times you can't be a tantric master without some strong
visualization abilities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, the notion
that one can write an email or do engineering, which inherently
involves abstraction (mathematics) and other concepts being converted
into actuality, or even speak and have it not involve thought, is one
that I think is merely a conceptual understanding itself and thus an
arbitrary designation. Further, as intentions fall into the realm of
thought, and all physical actions are preceded by intentions by the
fixed mechanics of the system, the notion that action can occur
without thought falls into the same camp. This also applies to all
such things as memory, which you clearly demonstrate, as this
inherently must involve thought essentially by definition (with
caveats as above).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Given those
assumptions, the question I ask is: have you simply stopped calling
those processes &quot;thought&quot; so as to fit with an arbitrary
and dogmatic model? Perhaps have you forced yourself to stop noticing
that mental processes occur as you thought that was supposed to
happen? Maybe you have achieved something real and because of your
preconceptions choose to describe it through that terminological
filter, or have achieved something completely different from those
that is not on my radar screen for whatever reason, possibilities
including my own delusion or lack of experience, just for the sake of
completion and reasonable skeptical doubt, which is always a good
idea.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The terminology that
I am used to involves seeing thoughts as they are, thus having them
be just a very small and transient part of the natural, causal field
of experience. However, it must also be admitted that, since thoughts
can only be experienced as aspects of the other five sense doors,
then labeling thought as thought is also just an abstraction and just
as arbitrary as is labeling the other 5 sense doors as such. These
are simply convenient designations (thoughts) for the sake of
discussion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When one notices
that all things simply arise on their own, including those sensations
that may or may not be designated as thoughts, to be empty of a self,
as they are and always have been, with no separate or independent
observer or controller or doer that is not just a part of the field
of experience or manifestation, then one has understood at some level
what the Buddha advocated that people understand. Thus, the model
that I prefer, as it is practical, non-esoteric and direct, is that:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. Sensations that
can be labeled as thoughts occur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. Thoughts are
natural, causal, and essential to nearly every function we perform.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. Thoughts are not
self, not other, part of life, and empty in the good sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">4. They always have
been this way, before and after any spiritual achievement, and when
their true nature is seen, they are still as they were.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">An essential
question regarding enlightenment is: does it make things different
from how they were, or does it merely reveal a true and accurate
perception or perspective on how everything always was? I advocate a
moderated version of the latter view, as I believe it is more helpful
to practice and more accurate. Thus, in this view, which is just one
view, anything that could happen before, such as thought or
visualization, can happen after, with the only thing changing being
some untangling of the previously held knot of tangled perception.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In terms of my
experience, another interesting conceptual designation, and using
relative and down-to-earth language, I can make my inner voice as
loud as it could be before, it is much more clear than it was before,
it is perceived as part of the natural field of causality in a way
that it was not before, and mindfulness comes and goes as before. In
high jhanic states the inner voice is very subtle, but I can still
visualize as before, sometimes with even more clarity depending on
practice conditions. In short, I have not lost abilities nor have I
changed much about the way the system operates. That said, something
is clear that was not clear before, and the sense of a special center
point seems seen through, though the sensate patterns that made it up
generally seem to still occur as before, and it is only the
perception of them that is different.” (end of email)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As you can see, I
sometimes write long emails for worthy dharma questions, but must
admit I only have the time to do this because the number of people
who ask me questions as of this point is so very small. Anyway, back
to the models... 
</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5642_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_GOD_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_103"></a>
THE GOD MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On a very different
tangent, we have the God Models. While Buddhism pretends to be an
exception to the theological traditions, many Buddhists essentially
worship the Buddha as a God just as Christians worship Jesus as a
God. Further, the vast majority of the traditions that promote
awakening involve some sort of theological background or
underpinning, including Hindu Vedanta’s focus on the divine nature
of things, Islam’s Sufi’s focusing on The Friend or dissolving in
Allah, and Christianity’s various dissolution in God metaphors,
such as the Divine Marriage. Buddhism has the same problem at times
with the phrase Buddha Nature. These are interesting models to talk
about, and basically the question comes down to the distance between
“God” and one’s life. Those who believe in a God that is a
separate entity are already in trouble. Those who believe this entity
is far off in Heaven or largely unavailable are really in trouble.
However, those who believe in a “God” that is right here, right
now, and present in all things, including themselves, have a fighting
chance, and this is as practical a model for awakening as any other,
if done correctly, which it almost never is.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The problem comes
for those who believe in God Free Zones, that is, those places where
God is not. These tend to be people who believe in a limited,
abstract God. Most people who believe in God have not taken the time
to consider the question of whether or not they believe in God Free
Zones or a limited God. In fact, most people who believe in God in
the monotheistic sense would be offended by the notion that their God
was somehow limited. However, if you question them about whether or
not God is in their toilet paper or in a rock, or perhaps more
specifically IS the toilet paper, and is the rock, is their weird
popcorn fetish, is the annoying itch in their armpit, and actually is
everything else, even most people who in theory believe in an
omnipresent, unlimited, all-powerful God won’t go that far. This is
too bad, because if they did, they would have a good working model
for realizing that THIS IS IT, and so we are back to my original,
simple, excellent premise and test for good models of awakening.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here’s how this
works: if you believe that you are trying to see God, and you believe
that all creation is a manifestation not just created by God, but in
fact IS GOD, they you are back to basic insight practices: seeing the
sensate world exactly as it is, because there you will find ultimate
reality, or “God”, if you want to call it that. When the center
point is seen through by your careful investigation of all these
sensations, or all the aspects of God, then all that is left is just
all these sensations as before, that is, all this God. Thus, if one
is willing to really believe in a omnipresent God, then by truly,
deeply, directly perceiving all sensations to be just part of the
causal, natural unfolding of what they label God, all the boundaries
between what were self and other can be seen through, and the
phenomenal world is left doing its thing, thus the practitioner
realizes they always were part of God, in a sense, though these
designations are merely terminological one way or the other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, the problem
with God models typically is that people don’t take them far
enough, because if they do they can get into something really good,
though they could get their just as easily without them. All the
other ideals that are involved in becoming God or seeing God are just
more odd dreams and possible side effects of spiritual practice. I
have a few friends who saw visions while on LSD in which “God”
told them useful stuff, and this is fine, but this is back in the
realm of the powers and has nothing to do with awakening and only a
very limited amount to do with “God” in the ultimate sense.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5644_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_PHYSICAL_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_104"></a>
THE PHYSICAL MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On a completely
different track we have the Physical Models, which tend to involve
some kind of physical perfection or stylization. The old Theravada
texts go to great lengths to list the 32 interesting physical
qualities of the Buddha, such as having 40 teeth and arms so long
that he could touch his knees without bending down. It is interesting
how things change, as in our modern context that would make him look
more to us like a dentally challenged Cro-Magnon than a spiritual
superhero, but I digress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Numerous pop culture
sources make us associate interesting physical qualities or ideals
with spirituality, particularly yoga magazines and martial arts
movies. There is not much more to say about these models other than
they are amusing and completely inaccurate. We may imagine that
somehow enlightenment involves some kind of physical health, or think
that awakening or insight practice may cure 2 some illness, but I
wouldn’t bank on anything like this at all. That said, my friends
who regularly do practices like yoga and Tai Chi do tend to look
good, and this only makes sense. However, this is not related to
ultimate realizations except peripherally in that those practices
involve mindfulness and if done well can lead to real insights.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5646_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_RADIANCE_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_105"></a>
THE RADIANCE MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Related to the
Physical Models are the Radiance Models, which tend to involve
imagining that enlightened beings will have some kind of remarkable
presence, usually involving radiating love, charisma, wisdom, peace
or even physical light. A friend of mine used to joke about this by
saying that people in Western Vipassana at the Insight Meditation
Society thought that an arahat would be someone like Dipa Ma (a
talented practitioner of vipassana and samatha who died an anagami by
her own admission) but with light shining out of their ass. This is a
bit of an exaggeration, but it makes the point that these ideals are
so ingrained in us from many traditions that it is hard to not
imagine that enlightened beings must have something remarkable about
them that you could feel or see.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Everyone knows that
all saints have light coming out of their heads, as did Jesus. You
have only to look to medieval paintings to confirm this. The stories
of the Buddha are full of his marvelous presence. In fact, his very
first interaction with a human after his awakening went something
like this. The Buddha had gotten up after exploring the depths of his
realization and abilities. He decided to go try to find his five
companions who had been with him during his period of grave
asceticism, and surveying the world with his psychic powers found
they were at Benares. He took off walking down the road between Bodh
Gaya and Gaya, and the first person the Buddha talked to after his
awakening that wasn’t a god or a giant snake was the monk Upaka. I
quote the Buddha as he tells the tale, as rendered in Bhikkhu
Ñanamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi’s <u>The</u> <u>Middle</u> <u>Length</u>
<u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Buddha</u> , Sutta 26, as
it is so priceless and such a wealth of information about the origin
of these models and ideals:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>[Upaka
said] ‘Friend, your faculties are clear, the color of your skin is
pure and bright. Under whom have you gone forth, friend? Who is your
teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?’</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>I
[The Buddha] replied to the Ajivaka Upaka in the stanzas:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">‘<i>I
am one who has transcended all, a knower of all, <br/>
 Unsullied
among all things, renouncing all, <br/>
 By craving’s ceasing
freed. <br/>
 Having known this all <br/>
 For myself, to whom should
I point as teacher?</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>I
have no teacher, and one like me <br/>
 Exists nowhere in all the
world <br/>
 With all its gods, because I have <br/>
 No person for
my counterpart.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>I
am the Accomplished One in the world<br/>
 I am the Teacher Supreme.<br/>

I alone am a Fully Enlightened One<br/>
 Whose fires are quenched and
extinguished.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>I
go now to the city of Kasi<br/>
 To set in motion the Wheel of
Dhamma. <br/>
 In a world that has become blind<br/>
 I go to beat
the drum of the Deathless.’</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>[Upaka
replied] ‘By your claims friend, you ought to be the Universal
Victor.’</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">‘<i>The
victors are those like me<br/>
 Who have won to destruction of
taints.<br/>
 I have vanquished all evil states, <br/>
 Therefore,
Upaka, I am a victor.’</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The passage is
remarkable in that it sets out a large number of criteria and
specifics about what awakening means to the Buddha and to Buddhism in
such a short space. Further, what is interesting is the number of
times the word “I” appears. In fact, “Buddha” means something
like Awakened One, or “I am awake.” Thus, we see that the Buddha
had no trouble talking about what he had done and who he was, nor did
he have trouble thinking the thought “I”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We note his
remarkable presence and skin, and so have the first of the Buddhist
Radiance Models and Physical Models. We note that he says he is
superior to the Gods, which is sort of a God Model in and of itself,
except one better. He describes being free of all the taints and evil
states, which is a complex mix of Emotional and Psychological Models.
He also adds the drum of the Deathless, and here we have hints of an
Immortality Model or an Extinction Model, and while formally Buddhism
would reject both of these associations, aspects of both show up
often in the texts anyway. There is also a Transcendence Model, as he
says he is unsullied by all things, and also a Specific Knowledge
Model, as the Buddha says he is a knower of all. In short, he says he
has accomplished something remarkable, and asserts that he is going
to go tell others how to do exactly the same thing he did, or is he?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The question of how
the Buddha’s realization relates to what he was trying to teacher
others is a complex one. There are numerous passages where he says he
is quite different from and superior to all other enlightened beings,
and draws a clear line between himself and arahats. Thus, we have to
look carefully at what his claims about himself have to do with
others, and I devote the whole next chapter to this complex issue.
Suffice to say, the problem comes in when the ideals the Buddha
discusses as applying to himself, however mythologized we think they
are, are applied without careful investigation to enlightened beings
of theoretically inferior degree. Then there is the slippery question
of the Tibetans who purport to produce full Buddhas in one
lifetime...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Back to the issues
of whether or not enlightened beings have a special presence. I have
seen examples of both, though I suspect that in most cases their
presence was largely that way before they started doing spiritual
practice. Many people who have asked me questions about practice over
the years have hesitantly asked me if there was something remarkable
about my presence or how I was able to keep my realizations hidden at
work. I am both sorry and happy to report that I have no problems in
this regard at work and as far as I can tell have nothing whatsoever
that is unusual about my presence that wasn’t there long before I
got into all of this, other than the confidence and passion with
which I speak on the dharma. In short, the physical models and
radiance are just nice propaganda and another trap that people fall
into, both in their own practice and when evaluating the possible
level of realization of others.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5648_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_106"></a><a name="THE_KARMA_MODELS"></a>
THE KARMA MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Karma models involve
the promise that somehow realization eliminates, exhausts, cancels
out or moderates the forces of causality that would cause bad things
to happen to the realized being. Karma involves action and its
consequences, and in its simplest form is essentially the statement
that causes lead to effects in a lawful way. The subject is
imponderable, as the forces and factors involved are so vast and
complex that no mind can fully comprehend them. That said, many
models and Buddhist ideals subtly or overtly present models of
awakening that promise some sort of relief or freedom from adversity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, if we look
to the life of the Buddha, who by definition is as enlightened as it
gets in Buddhism, lots of bad things happened to him, at least
according to the texts. He had chronic headaches and back pain, got
illnesses, was attacked by bandits, people tried to kill him, his own
order broke into warring factions, people harassed him, and so forth
and so on. Thus, it is clear that even the Buddha was not free from
the laws of karma, and so it would seem naïve to assume that we were
also.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, the karma
models raise an interesting question, that of the timing of the
fulfillment of the promises of enlightenment and what this has to do
with death. The Theravada claims that the moment of complete freedom
from suffering is at the death of an arahat or Buddha, as it is only
then that there is no more coming into further birth and there is the
complete cessation of the senses that cause pain and discomfort. The
Tibetans would disagree, focusing on the perpetual life or continued
series of rebirths of a Buddha or Bodhisattva throughout time to help
awaken other beings. These conflicts bring us to other models, but in
fact are paradoxes created by misperception.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, the karma
models are not entirely junk. By seeing each thought, state and
emotion as it is, there is an increased ability to simply 6 watch
these arise and vanish on their own, thus allowing for the causal
force of them to not wash through to the future without some
moderation of intelligence and wisdom. In this way, past causes,
habits, tendencies and the like can be mitigated through clear
seeing, and the actions we take based on these that create future
causes can be done with more awareness, clarity, and a broader, more
inclusive perspective. This is not the same thing as eliminating all
“negative” karma, but it is practical, realistic and verifiable,
and thus represents the grain of truth found in the Karma Models.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5650_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_107"></a><a name="THE_PERPETUAL_BLISS_MODELS"></a>
THE PERPETUAL BLISS MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Perpetual Bliss
Models focus on enlightenment bringing on a state of continuous
happiness, peace, joy, or bliss. These are commonly found in
Hinduism, though they are in full force in Buddhism and other
traditions as well, e.g. Christianity’s “the peace that passes
all understanding.” Buddhism often describes Nirvana (Nibbana) as
synonymous with the highest happiness and the end of suffering, and
this end of suffering is the natural corollary of the Perpetual Bliss
Models. Perpetual Bliss Models and their corollaries are so pervasive
in the world of awakening as to be a central, nearly unassailable
tenant of most people’s core beliefs. I am sorry to say, they need
serious revision.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first point is
that about impermanence. Bliss, peace, happiness, as well as their
counterparts pain, chaos, and misery, are all transient phenomena,
subject to conditions, arising and passing like the weather. As Zen
says, the ten thousand joys and the ten thousand sorrows march
through our lives according to the laws of reality that have always
been in place. This returns us to the great question of realization:
does realization change things or does realization reveal how things
always were? I advocate a modified version of the latter view, both
for practice and for having sane models, but the dogma and those
selling something often stray into the promises of a radically
different and better existence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The standard
Buddhist argument is that by removing the condition, namely ignorance
or misperception, the suffering caused by this condition is also
removed. The question then is how much suffering is caused by that
particular condition and how much is caused by just being alive. I
assert that most of our suffering is caused by simply being alive,
but must concede that there is something about changing 7 something
in the relationship to the ordinary facts of life and humanity that
does help, and why I am so reluctant to admit that there is some sort
of peace that comes from realization is a question I am still looking
into. While I strongly believe that there are practical reasons not
to sell things in this way, I suspect that some residual quirk of my
personality is also at play here, and you may have already come to
that conclusion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The other side of
the Perpetual Bliss Models is the notion that somehow one will enter
into a permanent jhanic state, such as the 4th jhana or some sort of
Nibbanic jhana. These versions of the bliss models imply perfect,
continuous concentration untouched by circumstance or enhanced by
some sort of inborn wellspring of jhanic qualities. As noted above,
all the concentration states are temporary, not related directly to
realization, attained both by some who are enlightened and some who
are not, and thus are a false promise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, as so many
people get a taste of jhana and are sure this must just get better
and more continuous as they progress, they end up cultivating these
states again and again and get nowhere in insight practice. Further,
why would someone who was hanging onto a bliss model want to look
into suffering? They don’t, and so the chances of them coming into
real insight territory or handling the Dark Night well are slim. Now,
it is true that there is some sort of relationship between the
perspective on things that occurs in the first four jhanas and the
four paths, and the panoramic perspective of both the fourth samatha
jhana and the panoramic perspective of arahatship share some positive
aspects in common, but they are not the same thing, and even
mentioning these patterns and parallels is dangerous, as it can cause
a lot of misguided effort and assessment of where people are on the
path. I think that this is a good place to introduce the Tibetan
concept of the Three Kayas, as it has some useful aspects that help
make sense of these things.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5652_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_THREE_KAYAS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_108"></a>
THE THREE KAYAS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Contrary to what
some Tibetan Buddhists would tell you, arahats have a deep
understanding of what is meant by their teaching of the Three Kayas
or “Bodies of Understanding.” For me, the Three Kayas are very
close in meaning and implication to the scopes of the Three
Trainings. Arahats understand the fullness of the implications of
having been born and of there still being a body and mind (called the
8 “nirmanakaya” or “manifestation body”), relating to
training in morality. All teachings of dependent arising,
interconnection and interdependence fall into the realm of the
nirmanakaya.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Arahats know
intimately the fullness of the ordinary realities of the human
condition: sickness (physical and mental), health, sorrow, joy,
conflict, harmony, pleasure, pain, clarity and confusion, stupidity
and brilliance. All of these manifest according to the same natural
laws that have always been in effect, contrary to popular belief. A
body was born and it will get sick and die. The Eight Worldly Winds
of praise and blame, fame and ill repute, success and failure, and
gain and loss still blow impersonally as always. The laws of
biochemistry, physics and physiology still hold. We still have to pay
taxes. From a cynic’s point of view, the nirmanakaya is the most
disappointing aspect of enlightenment. Did one really imagine that
somehow it would be otherwise? Don’t believe the hype! Another of
the great Bill Hamilton one-liners was, “Suffering less, noticing
it more.” The more we wake up, the more we notice exactly what it
means to have been born.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The nirmanakaya is
what is meant by this passage pertaining to the arahat: “The
disturbances resulting from the taint of being can no longer be found
here, the disturbances related to the taint of attraction can no
longer be found here, the disturbances related to the taint of
aversion can no longer be found here, and yet there remains the
disturbances inherent in these six sense doors that are dependent on
a body and conditioned by life”, from Sutta #121, The Shorter
Discourse on Voidness, in <u>The</u> <u>Middle</u> <u>Length</u>
<u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Buddha</u>. Notice that
this says, “six sense doors.” Arahats still think, contrary to
occasional myths about “stopping thought”, as noted above. While
the content of thoughts is still inherently dual, the true nature of
the way thoughts manifest is absolutely non-dual. Arahats know both
aspects of thought directly, a bit like being able to see waves on
the ocean and yet also that the whole thing is made of water and
intimately connected. No wave would ever be fooled into thinking that
one wave was watching, controlling, or isolated from another.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The nirmanakaya is
also the aspect of understanding that has to do with personality,
habits and issues of character. Don’t imagine that just by
understanding the full ultimate truth of phenomena that these things
will somehow lose their considerable causal inertia. To paraphrase
Chi Nul, a great Korean Chan monk, just because the Sun is shining
brightly doesn’t mean that all the snow will instantly melt.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On a related theme,
the nirmanakaya also relates to the facts of the physiological
inertia and biological conditioning of the bodily aspects of the
emotional life. The mind of a true arahat is extremely resilient, but
the flesh works according to the same laws that were in place before.
The spacious mental resilience of an arahat has some positive
consequences for physical life, but it does not completely transform
it. Thus, physical sensations associated with hunger, pain,
tiredness, sexual arousal, nervousness, fear and all the rest are
still intimate realities for the living arahat when they arise and
are not inconsequential, though the points made above in the Karma
model about seeing things arise and vanish still apply. The
nirmanakaya includes issues of biochemistry and neurochemistry, and
all of the issues of mental pathology that may go along with these.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The nirmanakaya
bears out the truth so well articulated by Lao Tzu when he talked
about dark and light containing one another and difficulty and ease
complementing one another. No level of enlightenment will allow one
to just pick one’s favorite half of reality or humanity and
eradicate the rest. This simply never happens and is not possible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think that
everyone on the spiritual path should occasionally sit down with a
piece of paper and list their favorite half of reality that they
imagine or wish would be left if they got fully enlightened, and then
list all the aspects of reality that they wish or “know” would
vanish forever. They should then list the things that they imagine
would show up as a result of full realization that are not here now.
The differences between these lists often point directly to what
blocks the development of wisdom from clear acceptance and
understanding of reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Even arahats and
buddhas have a favorite half of reality as well as dreams about how
things could be, so these dreams are not the problem. The difference
is that highly realized beings understand directly that both the
“good” and “bad” halves are of the nature of ultimate truth,
including all thoughts about them, and this makes all the difference.
These sensations flicker effortlessly and vanish, getting no more nor
less consideration than they are due. The point I am trying to make
here is to include the sensations that make up your world in your
practice, and don’t retreat into idealized fantasies of what
realization will be like, though notice such sensations if and when
they occur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Lastly, the
nirmanakaya relates to our “stuff,” our issues, our childhood
traumas, our dark secrets. I have routinely mentioned that when doing
insight practices one should try to see these things at the
moment-to-moment level. However, one must also find a way to deal
with our stuff in the traditional ways, or perhaps non-traditional
ones. Just do this work when not doing insight practices. While there
are connections between these two types of work, they are often in
direct conflict. Make time for the macroscopic, when we face and
learn about how to live well in the world in terms of emotions,
issues, conflicts, tears, joys, people, jobs and relationships.
However, also make time during which you resolutely put all of that
behind you, time when you stay at the level of flickering sensations.
Unhealthy fixation on either perspective is guaranteed to cause
problems.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Arahats also have a
wondrous understanding of all of this that is unique to them and
buddhas (though there may be hints of it at third path) called the
“sambhogakaya.” They know that the full range of phenomenal
reality and even the full range of the emotional life can be deeply
appreciated for what it is. They see that the world of concepts,
language, symbols, visions, thoughts and dreams is fundamentally the
same as the world of materiality, that they both share the same
essential nature from an experiential point of view. The first line
of the Gospel of John, “In the beginning there was the word, and
the word was God,” is a nice way to put it. For those who find this
phrase too cryptic, I paraphrase it as: “From the beginning,
concepts, words, dreams, visions, and the realm of thought have
always been an aspect of ultimate reality.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, in some
strange way even the worst of the world has a richness of texture
that can be deeply enjoyed, and a mysterious and sometimes
awe-inspiring glory mixed into it, inherent in it. What they were
looking for was permeating all the sensations without exception that
had made up their world all along! What staggering irony this is, and
what a silent joy it is to discover this at last. This is what is
meant by “the bliss of Nirvana.” It is a more subtle
understanding than the nirmanakaya and in some largely mysterious way
does not contradict it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Beyond even this,
they also understand in real time what is meant by the dharmakaya,
that somehow none of this is they, and that “what they are”
cannot be fundamentally harmed, disturbed or affected by the world of
phenomena in any way. The dharmakaya seems to simultaneously pervade
all of this, not be all of this, and be utterly beyond all of this.
It seems to be permanent and yet unfindable, be empty and yet aware.
Even this paradoxical language is hopelessly crude and from a certain
point of view unnecessary, though an arahat would know directly what
it is pointing to. This is what is meant by “going beyond birth and
death,” “Samsara is Nirvana,” “the arahat is traceless here
and now,” “True Self” and “no-self.” Interestingly, the
nirmanakaya also relates directly to both “True Self” and
“no-self.” There is something beautiful and yet tragic in this, a
“dark comedy” as a friend of mine put it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To even say that the
dharmakaya is a very subtle understanding makes no sense, as the
understanding of dharmakaya arises more from what is absent rather
than a sense of the presence of something. On the other hand, the
presence of everything bears witness to it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">All three
understandings (the nirmanakaya, the sambhogakaya, and the
dharmakaya) are accessible to the arahat at any time by the mere
inclination towards them, which is to say these perspectives arise
dependent on causes in their own time. They are three complementary
perspectives on the same thing. It is like being able to see the
validity of the perspective of all of the three people in the classic
Taoist painting called “The Vinegar Tasters,” with Confucius and
his laws for living in the world relating to the nirmanakaya, Lao Tzu
and his deep appreciation of life relating to the sambhogakaya, and
the Buddha and his emphasis on Nirvana and going beyond suffering,
birth and death relating to the dharmakaya. Most people think of this
painting as a Taoist slam on the other two traditions, but I think
that the deeper meaning is much more useful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The teaching of the
Three Ultimate Dharmas of materiality, mentality and Nibbana that I
articulated earlier is closely related to the Tibetan concepts of the
Three Kayas or aspects of the fully enlightened condition. The
nirmanakaya relates to form, the sambhogakaya relates to the
enjoyable, quiet and spacious peace of the fully enlightened mind
that unifies the mental and physical into the same field of
experience, and the dharmakaya relates to Nibbana.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Were only the
nirmanakaya true, we could say that unitive experiences are the
answer and that we are the whole field of experience. Were only the
dharmakaya true, we could say that transcendent “experiences” are
the answer, that we create and know the whole field of experience,
that we do not exist, and that we are the deathless or God. Neither
of these frameworks can clearly explain things on their own, and so,
as mentioned in the chapter called No-self vs. True Self, none of
these descriptions really holds up to reality testing on its own.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Presenting the Three
Kayas also allows me to continue to hammer relentlessly on the point
about people wanting to find some spiritual reality other than this
one. The huge temptation when walking the spiritual path is to try
desperately to find a way to get the simple ease of the sambhogakaya
and the indestructible, transcendent and deathless luminosity of the
dharmakaya while secretly hoping that the down to earth, mundane,
intimate, visceral, vulnerable, and often embarrassing nirmanakaya
will just sort of crawl away and die or at least radically reform
itself. The nirmanakaya is often treated as though it were the
bastard stepchild of the fully enlightened condition, but you can’t
have one without the others. <i>Intimacy</i> <i>with</i> <i>reality</i>
<i>is</i> <i>bought</i> <i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>price</i> <i>of</i>
<i>attaining</i> <i>transcendence</i> <i>beyond</i> <i>reality</i>.
<i>Transcendence</i> <i>is</i> <i>bought</i> <i>at</i> <i>the</i>
<i>price</i> <i>of</i> <i>attaining</i> <i>intimacy</i> <i>with</i>
<i>reality</i>. These inescapable facts should not be forgotten.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The all too common
temptation of those who advertise and sell spirituality is to sing
the praises of the sambhogakaya and dharmakaya while trying to gloss
over the profound yet down to earth implications of the nirmanakaya.
Buyer beware! If enlightened beings didn’t feel the fullness of
their humanity and the ordinary world, compassion for themselves and
others would be completely impossible. From a Tibetan point of view,
it is because enlightened beings progressively lose their artificial
defenses against the nirmanakaya that they have no choice but to be
bodhisattvas, which brings us nicely to our next model...</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5654_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_IMMORTALITY_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_109"></a>
THE IMMORTALITY MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Immortality
Models are significantly more prevalent in Tibetan Buddhism than the
other strains, thought they also appear in Pure Land Buddhism and are
found elsewhere. While all strains of Buddhism on the one hand
categorically deny immortality as the goal based upon the standard
tenants of Buddhist logic, plenty then turn around and sell
immortality like used car salesmen. So many Buddhists want to be up
in the Heaven called Nirvana as empty yet separate beings who don’t
exist and yet live forever as Bodhisattvas saving the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While there are lots
of good points in the Bodhisattva Vows, this is yet another case of
bait and switch where the results will be a bit more down to earth
than most people are bargaining for. However, many Buddhists are so
brainwashed into the ideal of becoming Amazing Super Beings that they
readily give up the notion that they could really understand anything
in this lifetime in exchange for the dream that some zillion
lifetimes down the road they may get to be Spiritual Superstars.
However, as their mentality can be essentially like people who have
bought into some weird cult, I don’t recommend trying to convince
them otherwise, as it generally just pisses them off. Just do your
practice, take care of your own understanding, and then see what you
can do from there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, as before,
there is some weird truth to the immortality models on two fronts.
First, from a technical point of view, what is traditionally called
the Dharmakaya, Deathless, Nirvana, Tao, Void, Buddha Nature, etc. is
indestructible, timeless, etc., but this is because it is not
anything specific. This has already been discussed, and simply
stated, from this point of view the notion of death or impermanence
simply does not apply. The flip side of this, that of the ordinary,
transient world, Nirmanakaya, etc., is that causality rings on
indefinitely. This is an interesting way to look at things, and a
very practical, insight-oriented way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">From the point of
view of time, cause and effect, things ripple out into the universe
like drops of water cause ripples in water. This process, that is to
say the world and us, has always been empty. If we are anything, it
is a pattern of rippling sensations arising from causes and effects
and leading to causes and effects. Thus, we send ripples of whatever
and however we are out into the causal future. If we are enlightened,
that is one aspect of what ripples out into the patterns we call
time, and these ripples go on without definable end. Teachings of
reincarnation are getting at this point in their somewhat problematic
way. Thus, we see that there is something to the Immortality Models,
but they are not very helpful for doing insight practices except to
help one appreciate causality. I think they are much more useful for
training in morality, despite their obvious paradigmatic problems.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One great
traditional analogy goes as follows: If you lit a candle, then lit
another candle with that candle and then blew out the first one, what
is transmitted? This is causality without a permanent entity,
resonance without continuity, an artificial but useful recognition of
a pattern, and nothing more.</p>

THE TRANSCENDENCE MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Related to the
Immortality and Bliss Models, we have the Transcendence Models. These
essentially promise that you will have the best of both worlds: you
will get to be in the world while not of the world, be able to enjoy
all pleasant things while being immune to pain and difficulty, and
thus live in a protected state of partial, selective transcendence. A
lot of people try to emulate such a state in their practice: when
presented with suffering they either look away from it or try to make
their attention so wide or vague that they don’t notice it, and
when pleasant things arise they try to hang on to those experiences
and expand them. While such a perfectly natural thing to do, this is
the exact reverse of insight practice, and yet they may deeply feel
that this is practicing for the transcendence they have been
promised.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As stated earlier,
the predictable and obvious truth is that&nbsp;&nbsp; ranscendence is
bought at the price of a very deep, direct intimacy with life, all of
life, both good and bad. Similarly, this deep intimacy with life is
bought at the price of transcendence. While everyone nearly
automatically looks to the good side of both, few consider that
realization brings a deep, direct experience of all that is painful
and also the reluctant understanding of how empty and ephemeral
pleasure is. One must be careful here, and I don’t advocate buying
into either extreme. Our ordinary lives have all this already, so
don’t look for something that is different from what is going on.
Instead, look into your 315 life as it is and see the Three
Characteristics of it directly, instant by instant. This is the
gateway to the answer to the strange paradox that all this is
pointing to.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5658_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_EXTINCTION_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_111"></a>
THE EXTINCTION MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the flip side of
the Immortality Models, and somewhat contrary to the Transcendence
Models, we have the Extinction Models. These are essentially a
promise that insight practices will either have you never be reborn
again or will make you non-existent somehow in some ordinary sense.
The first basic flaw in these models is that they presume an entity
to which these things can occur, which from an insight point of view
is already a problem. Insight practices at their best presume
emptiness as always having been the case, and so to posit that there
is something that was reborn flies directly against their root
premises. Thus, the notion that there is someone who either will not
be reborn again or will somehow cease to be (assuming they were
“being” before), is absurd and doesn’t belong in the language
of ultimate wisdom. However, page after page, Buddhism promises that
there will be no more coming into any state of being, no more
rebirth, no more self, and that somehow this will get someone off of
the wheel of suffering.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here we get into as
gray an area as it gets in spiritual language. Between the weird
promises of the Immortality Models and the weird promises of the
Extinction Models, we can really get into paradigmatic trouble.
Somehow we are sure that one of these must be right, or maybe both
are, or perhaps neither are, or some other combination we currently
can’t conceive of must be the correct one. However, all of these
models are based upon a fundamental flaw, the misperception of
sensations and the conclusion based on this misperception that there
was some separate, permanent us that all these dualistic concepts can
apply to. There is not, nor has their ever been, though sensations
occur anyway. It is a convenient, practical, working assumption, a
convention, a way of speaking, but nothing more. Thus, all of these
curious notions simply do not apply. Simply practicing and perceiving
sensations clearly reveals the way out of these paradoxes.

<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5660_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_LOVE_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_112"></a>
THE LOVE MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On a completely
different note, there are the Love Models. These are hard to relate
to any previous category except perhaps the Emotional Models, but
they essentially involve some combination of us loving everyone,
feeling love all the time, becoming Love itself, being loved by
everyone, or some combination of these. The first two are commonly
found in various references, such as Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj’s
famous quote, “Wisdom tells me I am nothing. Love tells me I am
everything. Between these two my life flows.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is really not a
bad quote as quotes go, as it tries to encompass the apparent
paradoxes of spiritual understanding. It is basically a restatement
of the Tibetan concept of balancing emptiness and compassion, and I
like it for this reason. However, lots of people think that
enlightened beings will be radiating love all the time, walking
around saying loving things, feel profound love for all things at all
times, and the like. Unfortunately, things couldn’t be further from
the truth. While it does get sometimes easier to take the wider world
of beings into consideration as the center point is seen through,
this is very different from walking around in a state of continuous
love.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">More sinister, deep,
rarely articulated and yet compelling is the notion that somehow we
will get enlightened and then people will not just like us, they will
love us. Wow, does that one not withstand reality testing. Take the
history of any of your favorite spiritual superheroes, the Buddha,
Jesus Christ, St. John of the Cross, Rumi, etc. and notice the
reactions people had to them. The notion that somehow you will be
embraced, accepted, appreciated, respected, adored, cared for, or
even liked by anyone just because of realization is, tragically, just
another beautiful, delusional dream. In short, think twice before
quitting your day job or walking down the middle of the street in
your guru outfit proclaiming your realization for all to love.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it is true that
you can borrow a lot of pre-programmed respect from some people just
by ordaining, which, viewed another way, means that ordination might
get you the respect that your realization should, in some idealized
universe, provide for you. However, this will be to a strangely
select audience, and the games you have to participate in to be a
part of that group are significant. You can also get a lot of respect
by getting on some senior teacher list, but there are subtle forces
that then come to bear that will have you denying a lot of your own
humanity when in public, thus leading to the shadow sides I mentioned
above. These points also hint at the Social Models that will follow
in a bit.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5662_1179888903"></a><a name="THE_UNITY_MODELS"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_113"></a>
THE UNITY MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Related to the Love
Models are the Unity Models, those that promise a palpable sense of
your connection to everything else. This is another one of those
models that contains some sort of truth, but is in fact one far
extreme side of the unity/extinction paradox. What we generally
imagine is that we will stay an agent, a separate, conscious,
in-control being and yet will be part of everything in some
mysterious way, such as either feeling everything else at all times
or even more ludicrous, being in control of everything else at all
times. I have already spent a lot of time on this model in the
section called No-Self vs. True Self and in previous models, so will
move on with the simple statement that those that believe in unitive
models are missing something fundamental.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5664_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_114"></a><a name="THE_SOCIAL_MODELS"></a>
THE SOCIAL MODELS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the same vein as
the Love Models are the Social Models. These tend to involve all
sorts of social implications or issues around enlightenment. For
instance, we may imagine that enlightenment will automatically have
certain desirable social implications, such as being accepted in a
particular social role, such as that of a teacher, guide, mentor,
spiritual friend, guru, leader, avatar, etc. This usually involves
some poorly defined group of people accepting us. While spiritual
attainments and unrelated qualities can sometimes inspire people to
view us in these ways, there are absolutely no guarantees.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As I have pointed
out before, plenty of people with wisdom have been ridiculed,
ostracized, persecuted, attacked, jailed and murdered when they spoke
from that place. In short, any social implications of one’s
realization (assuming one is correct in claiming or believing it)
will be at the mercy of ordinary causal reality, just as with
everything else, and ordinary causal reality can really suck
sometimes. Further, the vast majority of people don’t really have
any clue what enlightenment is about, don’t think that
enlightenment really exists today, may not have enlightenment as part
of their view of what possible or even desirable, or may even find
the notion that you think you are enlightened to be a threat to their
religious beliefs or an indication of your grandiosity, arrogance,
delusion, or psychosis. Having lived with these issues for over a
decade, I can tell you that these reactions are as likely to be found
in the social circles of Buddhism as they are in the social circles
of any other meditative or non-meditative religious or non-religious
tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Other Social Models
involve enlightenment having something to do with other people’s
opinions regarding whether or not we are enlightened, meaning that
enlightenment is purely a social convention or collective designation
and has nothing to do with reality or the individuals perception of
it. In this model, just as we may elect a president (or at least
believe we are casting votes for one), so it is with enlightenment.
This is actually fairly common in a number of Western Buddhist
circles, including some major retreat centers, in which they all bow
to the senior teacher list and yet hold the paradigm that no one
really gets enlightened. While all basically the neurosis of
spiritual children, there are actually some real, practical truths
hidden in this model.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While our direct
perception of reality will depend on our practice and insights, any
attempts at directly promoting similar insights in others will be
greatly helped or hindered by what people think of us, whether or not
we are given some title, whether or not a lineage accepts us as a
teacher in that lineage, and whether or not the concepts and language
we use to describe and sell our realization fit in with the cultural
expectations and norms of our social circles. Further, there are
those who falsely think they are enlightened because someone else
thinks they are, and plenty of people on senior teacher lists that
probably shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One way or another,
it is worth examining our deepest beliefs regarding the social
implications we imagine will occur when we get enlightened or more
enlightened. These can have a big impact on our practice, our
motivation to practice, and what kind of successes and failures we
have in spreading insights around once we have insights ourselves.
Unfortunately, most of our beliefs are likely to be somewhat
unrealistic, springing from the understandable human need for
recognition, role, and social status. Again, the further we find our
dreams from our current reality, the more we need to look at what is
happening right now, with those dreams and needs being one small part
of the transient, causal sensations that are arising and vanishing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Stated in practical
terms and by way of example, you could be a foreign medical grad that
had trained well in some foreign school, completed a good foreign
residency, be perfectly qualified to practice from the point of view
of knowledge, experience and talent, and yet not be allowed to
practice in the United States until you had jumped through all the
hoops. The same problem can arise when people go outside of a
tradition or partially outside it and yet do very good insight work.
They have the knowledge but not the social designation. Like the Tin
Man in the Wizard of Oz who lacks a diploma, those who are
enlightened who have not gone through standard channels can run into
problems. That said, it also gives the freedom to speak out without
worrying about those channels liking what you say, and there is much
about the standard channels to speak out about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I myself exist in a
gray area like this, as do many modern teachers. I have accomplished
much using the techniques of the Theravada, a tradition that
explicitly says that only monks can know what I know and usually only
recognizes monks as lineage holders. This is a cultural and social
problem, and highlights the truth embodied in the social models. I
suspect there will be a lot more of this as the dharma moves into the
modern era and more people are successful. We need to come up with
solutions to this problem that neither artificially elevate people
nor artificially prevent them from sharing what is they know that is
of benefit to others.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5666_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_115"></a><a name="THE_THREE_YANAS"></a>
THE THREE YANAS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While I am generally
a die-hard fan of the Theravada, I have a great appreciation for much
of the rest of Buddhism and the world’s other great mystical
traditions. In that spirit, I offer the following. Traditional
Tibetan training is broken down into Three Yanas or vehicles: the
Hinayana, the Mahayana and the Vajrayana. These correspond very
nicely to the needs of practitioners at various stages of the Simple
Model presented above. The Hinayana is a set of techniques and
practices that closely resembles many of the traditional trainings of
the Theravada, and these are often confused for this reason. (There
are some historical relationships between the two that I do not wish
to go into.) The Hinayana’s emphasis is on basic morality,
stabilizing the mind, and looking into the Three Characteristics,
i.e. all of the fundamental practices and emphases that I mentioned
in Part I. It is designed to get a person to the first stage of
awakening, i.e. first path, which the Tibetans would call third path
in the Tibetan Five Path Mode, or attaining the first bhumi.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Getting to the next
stage of the simple model or third path involves a deep appreciation
of interconnectedness in real time and a willingness to surrender to
it. The Mahayana path provides methods for understanding this in
abundance with its strong emphasis on helping others and on the
intrinsic emptiness (“shunyata”) of phenomena. The Bodhisattva
Vow, a fundamental part of the Mahayana path, not only expresses a
deep willingness to surrender to and understand interconnectedness,
but its emphasis on not becoming a full buddha can help people get
away from the temptation of purely future-oriented goals and
grandiose visions of perfection that can still be quite a challenge
at this stage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To get to the next
stage, one must completely understand the&nbsp;&nbsp; ntrinsic
luminosity of all phenomena without exception. The Vajrayana path,
with its emphasis on intrinsic luminosity and Tantric techniques that
work with the awakened nature of the fullness of the emotional range,
fits very well with the needs of one trying to gain the final
understanding that emptiness is form. Dzogchen teachings also
explicitly emphasize inherent luminosity and that all things are of
the nature of truth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I am still a big fan
of the Theravada, obviously, but I have a strong appreciation for the
tailored beauty of the Three Yana system of the Tibetans. It has an
uncanny sophistication to it and is part of what happens naturally
even if you are following Theravada techniques. I am also a big fan
of Zen, particularly its strong emphasis on keeping things down to
Earth, e.g. “After enlightenment, the laundry.” If you learn any
of these traditions well, you will come to see that they each contain
the others. As always, it is not the tradition that is important, but
that it work for you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In short, the
non-duality models are the only models of awakening that hold up
without apology, qualification or exception. The rest of the models
have serious problems, though each may contain some amount of truth
in it, however poorly conveyed. Given sufficient experience of the
real world, those who believe in literal interpretations of such
confused models as the limited emotional range models and limited
possible action models will either:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">1. Be forced to come
to the conclusion that no living being meets their definitions of
enlightenment,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">2. Be forced into a
dark corner of borderline-psychotic rationalizations of what actually
happens, or</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">3. Be headed for a
very rude awakening indeed, to make a bit of a bad pun.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is only one
thing worse in my mind than students getting caught up in the dogma
of the worst of the models, and that is realized teachers getting
caught by them. Just as it is disappointing when those with long
retreat resumes but no fundamental insight want to encourage faith in
their beautiful tradition by appearing to know more than they
actually do, it is doubly disappointing when realized beings can get
caught in these fallacious models, acting as if they worked in the
fantasy-land way that most people think they do. I know exactly where
they are coming from and how tempting this is, but I dream of a day
when such things never happen. The dharma world would be so much
better off if teachers were honest about what realization is and
ain’t, both with their students and also with themselves. Don’t
think this sort of dishonesty doesn’t occur. I have seen some of my
very best and most realized teachers fall into this trap and have
also done so myself more times than I can count. Learn from those who
have had to learn the hard way and are willing to admit this.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5668_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_116"></a><a name="DITCHING_OUR__STUFF__VS__DITCHIN"></a>
DITCHING OUR “STUFF” VS. DITCHING THE SPLIT</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">While these two
models are stated implicitly above, I thought I would summarize them
again to make sure that I have made this important point clear. There
are models of awakening that involve getting rid of all of our
“stuff”, i.e. our issues, flaws, quirks, pains, 2 negative
emotions, traumas, personalities, cultural baggage, childhood scars,
relationship difficulties, insecurities, fears, strange notions, etc.
Such models underlie most of the mainstream visions of spiritual
attainment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What is funny is
that lots of people spend so much time working so hard to get rid of
all their stuff but think that enlightenment, i.e. ditching the
illusion of the dualistic split, is largely unattainable. I have
exactly the opposite view, that ditching the split is very attainable
but getting rid of all of our stuff is completely impossible. When I
hear about those who wish to attain a type of Buddhahood that is
defined by not having any stuff, I usually think to myself that the
countless eons they usually claim are necessary to accomplish this
are a gross underestimation. The real world is about stuff, and
enlightenment is about the real world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What is very nice
about ditching the split, aside from the fact that it can be done, is
that now we can be friends with our stuff naturally, even if it
sucks. We can work with it as well as can be expected and from a
place of great clarity and understanding. Stage by stage, ditching
the split makes all the slow but necessary healing so much easier or
at least more tolerable. Thus, take the time to work with your stuff,
or try not to, as you like. Our stuff is here and being dealt with
anyway. However, seriously consider also doing the practices that can
ditch the split, i.e. those that ask us to see the true nature of the
sensations that make up all of our stuff and our attempts to deal
with it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Try these two
scenarios on for size and see which seems to fit with your goals for
your life, with your vision of a life well lived. In the first,
imagine working with your stuff as best you can for most of your
life, never really knowing what is just needless mind noise and
mental duress caused by a lack of basic clarity. In your old age you
do the practices that lead to realization. The benefits of that level
of understanding may then be used for yourself and others during the
remaining years of your life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the second
scenario, you take the time early in your spiritual practice to
attain to realization, following the precise instructions and
recommendations of a well-developed insight tradition. You then use
that level of increased clarity, acceptance, intimacy with life and
transcendence to work on your stuff and benefit others for the rest
of your life. The second approach seems vastly superior to me, but it
is still possible that these things are a matter of taste. One way or
the other, take responsibility for the choice you make.</p>
<h2 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5670_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_117"></a><a name="THE__NOTHING_TO_DO__AND__YOU_ARE"></a>
THE “NOTHING TO DO” AND “YOU ARE ALREADY THERE” SCHOOLS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On a somewhat
different note, I feel the need to address, which is to say shoot
down with every bit of rhetorical force I have, the notion promoted
by some teachers and even traditions that there is nothing to do,
nothing to accomplish, no goal to obtain, no enlightenment other than
the ordinary state of being, no practice or tradition that is of
value, no technique that will help. The other side of this same coin
is the point of view that you already are realized, already there,
already completely accomplished, and you essentially should be able
to just be told this by them to understand it for yourself, which,
were it true, would have been very nice of them, except that it is
complete bullshit. The Nothing To Do School and the You Are Already
There School are both basically vile extremes on the same basic
notion that all effort to attain to mastery is already missing the
point, an error of craving and grasping. They both contradict the
fundamental premise of this book, namely that there is something
amazing to attain and understand and that there are specific,
reproducible methods that can help you do that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here is a detailed
analysis of what is wrong with these and related perspectives. Some
defenders of these views will claim that they are the most immediate,
most complete, highest and most direct teachings that one could
promote, but I will claim that they do not lead to much that is good
that cannot be attained by conceptual frameworks that are not nearly
so problematic or easily misconstrued.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First, these notions
encourage people to not practice. The defenders can say what they
like, but again and again I see people who subscribe to these sorts
of notions resting on their cleverness and grand posteriors and not
actually getting it in the same way that my accomplished meditator
friends get it. It seems so comforting, this notion that you are
already something that you, in fact, are not, or that there is
nothing that you could do that would be useful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The notion that
people already are something begs the question: What are they? These
views tend to imply that they are already something such as perfect,
enlightened, realized, awakened, or 4 something even worse such as
Awareness, Cosmic Consciousness, The Atman, an aspect of The Divine,
etc. all of which cannot actually be found. While Buddhism does
sometimes go there, such as using terms such as Dharmakaya and Buddha
Nature, these are very slippery, high concepts that were added later
and require a ton of explanation and practice experience to keep them
from becoming the monsters they nearly always become in less
experienced hands.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Awakening involves
clearly perceiving universal characteristics of phenomena. While one
can attempt to rest comfortably in the intellectual notion that these
universal characteristics are there anyway and be comforted by
teachings such as easily misconstrued statements like, “I have
gained nothing by complete and un-excelled enlightenment,” the
whole, core, essential, root point of all this is that there is
something to be gained by becoming one of the people that can
actually directly perceive the true nature of things clearly enough
to fundamentally change the way reality is perceived in real-time.
The straight truth is that the vast majority of people do not start
out being able to do anything even close to this, and most are lucky
to be able to stay with three breaths in sequence before wandering
off into their neurotic crap, much less understand anything
liberating about those breaths. The notion that everyone already is
someone who can perceive reality the way the masters do without
effort in real-time is a fantastic falsehood, lie, untruth, and in
short, one great load of apathy-creating insanity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If one goes around
asking people without very good insight into these things, i.e. the
unenlightened, about basic dharma points, points that are obvious to
those who have learned to pay attention well, one does not find that
everyone already is a person who is perceiving things at the level
that makes the difference the dharma promises. Further, even those of
lower levels of enlightenment generally have a hard time saying they
really are able to perceive the emptiness, luminosity, selflessness,
causality, transience, ephemerality, etc. of reality in real-time at
all times without having to really do anything. In short, the notion
that this is as easy as just being what you already are is wildly off
the mark, as the vast majority of people are woefully underdeveloped
on the perceptual front in question. Thus, all reality testing
reveals that the two schools are missing a very fundamental point:
while the universal characteristics are always manifesting in all
things and at all times, there are those who can perceive this well
and those who cannot, and meditative training, conceptual frameworks,
techniques, teachers, texts, discussions and the like can all
contribute to developing the internal skills and wiring to be able to
fully realize what is possible, as thousands of practitioners
throughout the ages have noticed. I myself have known before and
after, meaning that I know what I was capable of perceiving and
understanding before I underwent meditative training and after, and
no amount of being fed the concept that I was already as developed as
I could be, was already enlightened, was already there, had nothing
to do, nothing to develop, was already as clear as I could be, was
already perfectly awake, etc. was going to make the difference that
practicing for thousands of hours over many years did.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It would be like
saying: you are already a concert pianist, you just have to realize
it, or you already are a nuclear physicist, you just have to realize
it, or you already speak every language, you just have to realize it.
It would be like saying to a two-year old: you already understand
everything you need to know so stop learning new things now, or to a
severe paranoid schizophrenic: you already are as sane as anyone and
do not need to take your medicines and should just follow the voices
that tell you to kill people, or to a person with heart disease: just
keep smoking and eating fried pork skins and you will be healthy, or
to an illiterate person with no math skills who keeps having a hard
time navigating in the modern world and is constantly ripped off: no
need to learn to read and do math, as you are just fine as you are,
or saying to a greedy, corrupt, corporate-raiding, white-collar
criminal, Fascist, alcoholic wife-beater: hey, Dude, you are a like,
beautiful perfect flower of the Now Moment, already enlightened
[insert toke here], you are doing and not-doing just fine, like wow,
so keep up the good work, Man.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Would you let a
blind and partially paralyzed untrained stroke victim perform
open-heart surgery on your child based on the notion that they
already are an accomplished surgeon but just have to realize it?
Would you follow the dharma teachings of people who feed other people
this kind of crap? Those who imagine that everyone somehow in their
development already became as clear and perceptive as they could be
just by being alive is missing something very profound. Do they
imagine that you can just remind people of these things and suddenly
all wisdom and clarity will suddenly appear? This is mind-bogglingly
naive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have gained so
much that is good and lost so much that is bad by learning to
practice well, learning to concentrate, learning the theory, learning
insight practices, going through the organic process of the stages
over decades, reading the stories, reading about the lives of the
great practitioners, having dharma conversations with dharma friends,
debating points, wrestling with difficult concepts and how to apply
them to my actual life, teaching, learning, studying, playing with
the powers, writing, realizing how things are, and delving deeply
into the sensate world that I am astounded that anyone would want to
try to reduce something so grand, wonderful, deep, rich, amazing and
profound to such a paltry, ridiculous concept as the notion that all
that is already in place in everyone regardless of what they have
done or not done. All those benefits, skills, abilities, powers,
states, stages, experiences, insights, and fundamental perceptual
changes simply were not available until I did the work, took the
time, participated in the process, and no amount of anyone telling me
it was otherwise would have helped or made it so.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I know of no
examples where the necessary and sufficient causes for the arising of
these benefits did not involve some kind of work. In short, I say to
those who persist in promoting the Nothing To Do School and the You
Are Already There School: STOP IT! You are spreading craziness, and
this is craziness that many people will not be able to tell is
craziness, and that appears to include those who promote these
fallacies. While I usually do not go so far as to tell people that
there is something so deeply wrong with what they think and how they
communicate it that they should stop it immediately and forever, this
particular point is a great example of something I consider abhorrent
and worthy of profound revision.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Regardless of any
kind intentions, the teachings of these schools take a half-truth
that seems so very nice and seductive to us neurotic practitioners
who just can barely stand another achievement trip and have such a
hard time with self-acceptance and turn that distortion into sugary
poison. There is no need to tie the three useful concepts of 1)
no-self, 2) self-acceptance in the ordinary sense, and 3) the notion
that the sensations that lead to understanding if clearly perceived
over and over again are manifesting right here, right now, to such a
perversely twisted yet seemingly benign and similar concepts as the
ones they unfortunately promote.</p>

FINAL POINTS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Spirituality that
ignores or covers up our inevitable dark or undesirable sides is
doomed to be bitten and burned by them. Models of realization that
involve high ideals of human perfection have caused so much
dejection, despair and misguided effort throughout the ages that I
have no qualms about doing my very best to try to smash them to
pieces on the sharp rocks of reality. They are not completely
useless, and there is some value in keeping the standards to which we
aspire high as we will see in the next chapter, but most of the time
are taken way too seriously to be helpful at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is clear that
those who adhere the most rigidly to the self-perfection models of
enlightenment are also very often those who believe enlightenment is
the least attainable and feel the most disempowered in their practice
and spiritual life. Not surprisingly, those with the highest
standards for what realization will entail often have the lowest
standards for their own practice and what they hope to actually
attain in this lifetime. They are the armchair quarterbacks of the
spiritual path. Becoming grandiose about aspiring to a high ideal
seems to be a common coping mechanism for dealing with a lack of
confidence and insight. As Christopher Titmuss, one of my best and
most honest teachers, often says, “We do not come from a
self-perfection lineage.” There are those who do explicitly come
from self-perfection lineages. I wish them good luck. They’ll need
it.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5674_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_119"></a><a name="31__SO_WHAT_S__FULL_ENLIGHTENMEN"></a>
31. SO WHAT’S “FULL ENLIGHTENMENT”? *</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This has been a
source of considerable debate, confusion and division in Buddhism,
particularly between the three main traditions of the Theravada,
Tibetan, and Zen. I am going to jump into the fray, as is my typical
style, but realize that it is going to be a messy business. These
debates tend to boil down to arahats vs. buddhas, a distinction I
hope to make clear shortly. Zen is largely on the side of buddhas,
though their intriguing vagueness on the subject can at times make it
somewhat uncertain what they mean by “buddha.” Most of the time
the Zen kids actually seem to mean “arahat” when they say
“buddha,” though I wouldn’t go around saying that if you want
to be liked. In my more cynical moments, I think their models end at
stream entry. On the other hand, the most mythological descriptions
of arahats in the Theravada are often closer to the stylized
descriptions of buddhas, so the problem is obviously widespread and
goes both ways. All kinds of absurd tensions and divisions have
arisen around this one point between the Theravada and the Mahayana
when, at least in terms of actual dogma, there is really no conflict.
How these ideals relate to non-Buddhist traditions is complex, and I
offer the simple notion that these things all converge rather than
diverge at this level.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Theravada
clearly acknowledges that an arahat is a stage below buddhahood, and
nouveau Tibetans seem particularly gleeful at this. (To digress again
for just a moment, there is an apocryphal and absurd story in
circulation that when the teachings on emptiness were first given, a
large number of arahats dropped dead of heart attacks. This tends to
cause conceited laughter and smiles on the faces of nouveau Tibetan
Buddhists, which is about as sick a reaction as I can imagine. When
will this sort of vile and absurd defamation of other valuable
traditions end?) The arahat has attained to the complete and utter
elimination of the illusions of permanence, satisfactoriness, and
duality (separate self), and now perceives reality non-dualistically.
They know the joy and clarity of freedom, as well as the fullness of
their humanity. Thus, the notion that an arahat is “self-realized”
is an oxymoron perpetuated by regular morons. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Arahatship may
correlate with the 6th bhumi or the 8th bhumi in the Tibetan model,
depending on the sources of information. There are also reasons to
associate it with the 10th bhumi, but I digress. Some Tibetan
Buddhists will tell you that the four paths and the ten bhumis are
two divergent tracks of awakening, but this is a load of equine
excrement. Ditching the split is ditching the split, and the rest is
gravy. Enlightenment is exactly the same regardless of the tradition
one followed to attain it. This is non-negotiable, and those who say
otherwise are merely doing so for recruiting purposes or because they
don’t know any better or both.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, it is
clearly stated by both traditions that arahats may not have
completely integrated their understanding into their life and so may
not have eliminated all “unskillful” residual habits, although
defining “unskillful” here is as problematic as defining
“appropriate.” There are many stories in <u>The</u> <u>Vinaya</u>
and in modern times about arahats behaving in strange ways, and this
goes ten times for buddhas in the Mahayana and Vajrayana literature
and today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Regardless of how
you define “unskillful,” eliminating all “unskillful”
residual habits is sometimes seen as such an undertaking that many
schools of Buddhism hold it to be an absurd and impractical ideal.
However, there is some place for such high standards if they are
supplemented with a very big dose of reality, patience and a sense of
humor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Buddhas are defined
as having mastered all of the concentration states and psychic
powers, whereas arahats may or may not have. (It should be noted that
even unenlightened beings can master almost all of the psychic powers
and all of the concentration states.) Buddhas are defined as having
understood the teachings and the truth of things “to the very end,”
whereas arahats have just fully understood these. The distinction
here is lost on me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Further, both sides
also state clearly that there are bodhisattvas that may one day
become buddhas. Again, to stick around requires being nothing but
empty awareness or dharmakaya (in True Self terms), as this is all
that is permanent but not a thing or localized in a specific place,
etc. as before. This understanding is clearly present in arahats,
bodhisattvas of the 8th bhumi and above, and buddhas. Thus, this
whole bodhisattva thing and all the talk of the Buddha manifesting as
a bodhisattva is just a skillful True Self or dharmakaya teaching, as
before, and not actually in conflict with the Theravada except to
those who misunderstand what these teachings are really talking
about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is this sort of
confusion that starts all sorts of absurd and completely useless
conversations about rebirth that take away time from real practice
and useful inquiry. All talk of Buddha Nature is actually this same
True Self teaching, as before. Balanced and strong understanding of
both emptiness and compassion is vital for understanding the Middle
Way and for benefiting others, and this point is found in all the
Buddhist traditions of which I am aware.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember how, in the
beginning of Part II, I stated that the point of all of this is to
become a master of the relative and the ultimate? When one becomes an
arahat, which could from one point of view be considered becoming a
master of the ultimate, then the relative world of phenomena is fully
understood to also be the ultimate. This then naturally brings in the
ideal of Buddhahood as the next logical standard to aspire to, as
suddenly one cannot truly be a master of the ultimate without also
being a master of the relative. Go become an arahat and see for
yourself what conclusion you draw from your experience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is a story of
a Thai arahat that took Bodhisattva Vows. In doing so, he pissed off
lots of die-hard Theravada fans, and many began to think that he must
not have actually been an arahat. Again, this is a fairly sick
reaction to a beautiful and noble acknowledgement that we can always
learn more about how to make a positive difference in this world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember long ago
when I mentioned that the first training was also the last training?
We must continue to find skillful ways to live in the world after
realizations, just like everyone else. On the other hand, the
attainment of arahatship is the final understanding that the whole
process is simply happening by itself, so whatever progress occurs
towards buddhahood and living well in the world, however defined, is
from that point on completely natural and inevitable. On reading the
old texts, it becomes very clear that not only do arahats have lots
left to learn about living in the ordinary world, but so did the
Buddha. He was constantly learning more and more about teaching,
dealing with people, and running a big organization. In short, don’t
imagine that you will ever be saved from having to learn how to live
well in the world. It is an endless undertaking.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the end, it must
reluctantly be conceded that final and full enlightenment involves
the death of a highly enlightened being, something called
“paranirvana” or “nirvana without remainder.” I don’t mean
to be needlessly morbid, but while there is still a body and a mind
there is still suffering as our old friend Sid the Buddha defined it,
and thus it is not until a highly enlightened being dies that the
whole process is completed. This is not meant in any way to promote
the suicide of highly enlightened beings, but simply to acknowledge
the implications of being born and to be doctrinally correct.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, this again
falls prey to the interconnectedness vs. complete transcendence
debates just as the arahat vs. Buddha debates do, so from a certain
point of view the question of what is full enlightenment cannot be
answered without all beings getting enlightened and then dying. This
is obviously unlikely to occur any time soon. However, from another
point of view all beings are already enlightened but have yet to
realize it, and thus the debate is meaningless. Thus, you now have
some understanding of why these ridiculous debates have been around
for so long and why I obviously am not going to resolve them here. As
with all logical systems that involve false assumptions of duality
(which they all do), any argument taken far enough either goes in
circles, contradicts itself or both. Put your time into clear
practice and not into thinking about these things too much.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5676_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_120"></a><a name="32__INTEGRATION"></a>
32. INTEGRATION*</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A friend of mine
read through an earlier version of this work and commented that there
was very little in this book on integration, the process by which
one’s life comes to be a natural reflection of one’s insights. I
replied that I would write something about integration when I knew
something about it, which he thought was funny, particularly knowing
me. However, over the years I have learned a few things about the
endlessly complex, mysterious and yet strangely ordinary topic of
integration and about living in the world during and in the wake of
insights. There are many sources, such as <u>A</u> <u>Path</u> <u>With</u>
<u>Heart</u> and <u>After</u>&nbsp; <u>the</u> <u>Ecstasy</u>, <u>the</u>
<u>Laundry</u>, both by Jack Kornfield, that do a much better
treatement of the issue than what follows, but hopefully some of
these simple points will be of use.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first point is
one that I have made implicitly above, but will make explicit here:
<i>Go</i> <i>ahead</i> <i>and</i> <i>get</i> <i>some</i> <i>deep</i>
<i>insight</i> <i>to</i> <i>integrate</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>first</i>
<i>place</i>. I have lots of friends on the spiritual path that seem
to be doing work that I associate with integration when they don’t
yet have any fundamental insight to integrate. This seems to be very
strange way to go, if you ask me. They seem to be working on their
stuff without the clarity and perspective that comes from
realizations into the truth of things. Go get enlightened! Become a
stream enterer at the very least and preferably become an arahat.
Without these realizations, it is very hard to determine what needs
work and what is just excessive delusion and mind noise created by
the illusion of duality that still remains.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, when on
retreat or doing formal practice, think carefully about what you want
to achieve. Do you want to work on your stuff or work on fundamental
insights? Realize that it might not be easy to do either, and so
might be very hard to do both simultaneously. Do you want to gain
deep insights and then work on your stuff from that foundation of
basic clarity, or do you want to work on your stuff until, until,
until when? Until you don’t have any stuff? Good luck!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That brings me to
the second point, which is to pick your battles. We can’t do
everything. We can’t have it all. We simply don’t have the time
or the energy. Spiritual technology will not change these simple
facts of life. We can only be working on so many things at once and
still do any of them well. We need breaks, downtime, and balance.
However, if we are wise and discerning, we can craft a set of
priorities for ourselves that honors our unique spiritual needs,
relationship needs, career needs, recreational needs, and family
needs, as well as the needs of others. We can do this in a way that
is realistic and allows us to keep making good use of our life
without burning out or stagnating. No one can ever tell you exactly
how to do this. You have your own needs and life situation. Work with
it as best you can.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The third point
about integration and living in the world that I have had to learn
the hard way is a concept that I recently heard articulated very well
by my friend Tom in the phrase, “Right plane, right time,” which
was his way of saying, “Use the correct conceptual and paradigmatic
framework for the correct situation.” Like the simple lists of Part
I, this phrase could be the basis of an entire book (see the
difficult but excellent <u>The</u> <u>Spectrum</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Consciousness</u>, by Ken Wilber, which spends a lot of time
explaining how to keep our paradigms straight and not mix them up).
From the point of view of integration, it basically means that one
generally should use a way of approaching a situation or problem that
fits with that situation or problem. One should be conscious of the
conceptual frameworks that one uses when approaching each aspect of
one’s life, as some conceptual frameworks or ways of being may not
be helpful or appropriate for certain situations. I will illustrate
this by way of some examples.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When doing insight
practices, is it useful to assume a few things. One should assume
that no such thing as a body exists, nor does a mind exist, nor are
there natural boundaries inherent in sensations. There are sensations
that arise and pass quickly, are not able to satisfy due to the
illusion of duality, and are “empty,” meaning that they imply no
self or separateness that is in control. It is not all that useful to
get overly concerned with what these sensations actually are or why
they arose.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When doing just
about everything else, this way of proceeding may cause gigantic
problems. For instance, when driving a car, one must assume that
one’s car is a separate entity, one that should not collide with
the other cars on the road. One must assume solidity and that one is
in control of one’s car, one must pay attention to the edges of
specific things, and be careful about the details of one’s driving
environment, one’s destination, and the rules of the road. For
“real world” problems, I have found that “real world”
solutions are the way to go. Right plane, right time. It must also be
said that paying more attention to our sensate world helps both with
insight practices and the “daily life.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another example to
contrast with the paradigm useful in insight practices is in human
relationships. Imagine someone saying to you, “You are so empty.
You are so unsatisfactory. You are so transient.” It just doesn’t
work. Imagine going into a bank at which you have recently overdrawn
your account and saying, “I do not exist as a separate entity.
There is no ‘I’ or ‘mine’ that can be found. Thus, all of
this talk of me owing you something is nonsense. We are
interdependent luminosity.” This just doesn’t fly. Right plane,
right time. These are ridiculous examples, but if you hang out in
spiritual scenes and pay attention to the conceptual frameworks
people use and when they use them, you will find numerous similar
errors in judgment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These examples also
illustrate the important concept of being careful when talking about
one’s practice. Chose the correct words or degree of silence for
the people around you and the situations in which you find yourself,
particularly soon after dramatic occurrences. I can’t tell you the
number of times I have looked like a completely inconsiderate nutcase
when I opened my big flapping pie-hole to the wrong people soon after
some intense insight or rapture had occurred. As a dead French
occultist once said, “To tell someone something they can’t
understand is as bad as telling them a lie.” Wise words. Cultivate
a network of friends with whom you can share these things, or keep a
diary if this is not practical, or both. There is something helpful
about being able to talk about unusual things in a safe and
appropriate context.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is not uncommon
for people who get deeply into practice to encounter two issues: that
it is difficult to learn to go easily between one way of being and
another, from one conceptual framework and another, and that practice
and “the world” seem to be in direct conflict. Given our basic
dualistic illusion, it often seems that we must let things go in some
sort of literal sense, such as quitting a job, in order to “let it
go” in the insight sense, to see the true nature of the sensations
that make up the process. This is obviously not true, but such
erroneous logic can be very tempting. As to the rest of integration,
well, if we have insights to integrate, it just seems to happen.
That’s about the best I can do. Life happens as before, and so it
goes. We grow, we learn, we get sick and we die. To quote a song from
a Bogart movie, “The fundamental things apply as time goes by.”
Go and read some extensive book on the subject and tell me whether or
not it basically said the same thing while using a whole lot more
words to do so. Still, such books can be helpful.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5678_1179888903"></a><a name="33__IT_IS_POSSIBLE"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_121"></a>
33. IT IS POSSIBLE!</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So why am I
mentioning all of these states and stages that are thought by many to
be largely mythical and unattainable? Because they are absolutely
otherwise, that’s why. People do attain these states today, though
they tend to only talk about them to their teachers and to close
friends who have enough experience in this stuff to understand and
not have odd reactions to these disclosures. I assure you that I
wouldn’t have bothered writing all of this if I didn’t think that
it was possible for those reading this book to master this stuff.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A friend of mine was
on a retreat in Burma and had attained to second path as confirmed by
U Pandita. He was finally done with his retreat and was taken to the
airport by one of the people who helped to run the monastery, who
incidentally was a stream enterer. As my friend was leaving, he
yelled to him across the terminal, “Come back for number three!”
meaning, “Come back and attain third path!” Note the many ways in
which what underlies this statement differs from the paradigm you
would likely find in your basic Western Buddhist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First, most Western
Buddhists don’t really believe that after a few months of good
practice you could get enlightened or more&nbsp;&nbsp; nlightened.
They do not believe it is simply a matter of following simple
instructions, moving through the clearly defined insights and tagging
a path. In fact, I often tell this story to Western Buddhists, many
of whom have been on numerous insight retreats lead by teachers
trained by the best Burmese masters, and they say things like, “What
do you mean, ‘third path’?” It makes me want to scream when
they don’t even know the basic dogma of enlightenment, much less
anything practical about it. Most Western teachers wouldn’t have
the guts to stand up and say, “Yeah, he did it, he got second path”
(assuming they would even been in a position to evaluate such a
person’s practice). Even if they did, it would likely be a huge,
taboo secret. Here’s my point: it can be done, it is done, it can
be done, and there are people who can help you do it!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Practice, practice,
practice! This is the big difference between those who are merely
into giving lip service to Buddhism and those who really get what the
old boy was talking about. Go on retreats and actually follow the
instructions to the letter all day long. Find people who know how it
is done and hang out with them. Keep it simple. Avoid magical
thinking and abandoning common sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The simple fact that
you have read this book means that the ball is now in your court.
There is more than enough information presented here on
straightforward techniques that have a great track record of
performing as advertised. As a large and wise chef in a gourmet
seafood restaurant once said to me, “I have two words for you:
perseverance furthers.”</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5680_1179888903"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_122"></a><a name="34__MORE_ON_THE__MUSHROOM_FACTOR"></a>
34. MORE ON THE “MUSHROOM FACTOR”*</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of the reasons
that more people who make progress do not talk about progress could
be the fact that, as practice deepens, the exaggerated importance to
the meditator of thoughts of “my attainment,” “I am
enlightened,” etc. gradually falls away and assumes its proper
proportion, its proper place in things. However, this does not mean
that such language cannot be used. While there may routinely be no
good reasons to talk about attainments, or even good reasons not to,
there is a long and glorious tradition of compassionate meditation
masters and enlightened beings who braved the consequences and told
the world that it could be done, that they had done it, and they were
going to tell all of those who hadn’t how they could do it too. The
results of this varied from founding major religions to being
executed or both, but such are the caprices of reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is interesting
that Buddhism started out very much as a tradition in which those who
were highly attained were often loudly proclaimed to be so by
themselves and others with the specific details of their skills and
understandings made clear. The motivation for this was that such
individuals were valuable resources for others and this should be
known for the benefit of all. This widespread cultural phenomenon of
meditation masters being “out” is abundantly clear in the ancient
texts, and occurs to varying degrees in Asian countries today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In the West, the
situation is often remarkably different from this early practice.
There seem to be two basic styles of code used when advertising
dharma teachers. The first is to simply use a grand title such as,
“Wazoo Tulku, Supreme and Luminous Dharma King.” The second type
of code is in the style of a resume for a job, “Jane Rainbow is the
author of three books. She has been teaching meditation for 17 years
internationally and is a member of the Buddhist Flower Society.”
Notice that neither of these bios tells you anything about:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">–what they may
actually know<br/>
 –which traditions they draw from<br/>
 –their
attitude towards scholarship and the standard dogmas<br/>
 –which
techniques they are masters of or teach<br/>
 –what they have
attained or claim to have attained<br/>
 –what their personality is
like<br/>
 –what their strengths and weaknesses as a teacher and
person are<br/>
 –who trained them<br/>
 –the lineage or lineages
by which they are claimed<br/>
 –their level of availability to
their students (though “teaches internationally” is often an
ominous clue)<br/>
 –why it is that they teach<br/>
 –what they
expect from their students, particularly as regards money, vows and
exclusive loyalty<br/>
 –how many students they already have<br/>

–whether or not they will talk about real practice directly<br/>

–if you run into trouble with them, is there a governing
organization that can address this</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What is astounding
is how few students will ever ask their teachers about any of these
specific practical issues. These are the questions that should be
initially considered when seeking a teacher, and yet you almost never
see them addressed on a retreat center brochure. Imagine a university
where none of the professors would tell you about their research, who
funds their work, where they got their degree, what courses they
teach, who taught them, what their specialty is, or even why they
like being professors. That would be just a bit strange, wouldn’t
it? This sort of information is typically available for public
consumption on the university web page.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is something
very balanced and reasonable about this. When I see a presentation at
the school I currently attend, someone generally tells you exactly
who the person is, what they are working on, highlights of what they
have published in the past, and what positions and degrees they
currently hold, and why they are qualified to speak on the topic of
the day. Perhaps I am particularly naïve and idealistic, but I
imagine a spiritual world where this would be standard practice as
well. I dream that this would simultaneously cut down on otherworldly
spiritual ideals, provide faith that it can be done, demystify the
process of awakening, and bring the whole thing back down to earth.
There is obviously a long way to go before such a dream is likely to
be a reality, but hopefully this little book will be one small step
towards that. There are cool things our minds can do and perceive,
and there are definable techniques that lead to those cool things.
Why does is have to be more complex than that?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In my more cynical
moments, I have sometimes thought that Western teacher bios could
just as easily read, “Jane is a Sagittarius from California. Her
favorite color is turquoise and she is a mediocre chef,” or “Wazoo
is old and of substantial girth. His favorite movie is ‘Animal
House.’” These would give you about as much practical information
as most teacher bios do in the West.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Obviously, the
assumption is that if they have been practicing for so many years,
have a fancy name, or if someone let them publish a book or teach
internationally, then they must be in some generic way a good teacher
of something. There may also be the unspoken assumption that there is
some unnamed but reliable body of evaluators of teachers somewhere
that have checked the person out. Either of these may or may not be
true, and some traditions do a much better job of being clear and
honest about these things than others do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some other reasons
that more people don’t talk about mastery when it actually happens
or clearly advertise themselves are that they don’t want to make
others jealous or intimidated. Also, talking about the stages of
insight practice can sound quite outrageous and bizarre. Further,
with clarity comes mystery, and sometimes it can seem inappropriate
to talk about something that can sometimes seem so slippery and
sometimes even uncertain. The late, great Achaan Chah once stated
that even arahats could sometimes be unsure about whether or not they
are arahats. (Others, including one of my favorite teachers, have
said that all arahats are always sure they are arahats. This second
view is a bit extreme, and is a limited possible thought model. You
know what I think of those!)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, a major reason
for secrecy or codes seems to be self-preservation, though not in the
sense of “ego” preservation. These are kind motives, but they
also perpetuate the atmosphere of secrecy and confusion so present in
the modern mystical world. The unfortunate truth is that talking
about attainments tends to cause many more unhelpful reactions than
helpful ones. It tends to isolate the person who has attained these
things, cause people to think of them as way too wonderful or
completely nuts (or both) and generally project all sorts of naïve
and unhelpful things onto them, such as a limited emotional range
model or even worse a limited possible action model. This can create
situations that foster the abuse of sex, money, drugs, and power that
seem to plague gurus and other spiritual teachers with some
regularity. Freud would have had a field day with this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As regards the
bizarre and fantastic projections that are commonly associated with
teachers, gurus, and all other potentially enlightened beings, they
tend to arise because there is not enough widespread information on
how misleading the limited emotional range models are and what
preposterous junk the limited possible action models are, not to
mention the lack of information on the absurdity of the wide range of
other magical attributes that are imagined to arise from simply
ceasing to identify with ordinary phenomena. I considered writing a
whole chapter called “Adults in Fantasyland,” but hopefully the
preceding sentence will do the trick.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This lack of
information on the ordinariness of realized individuals creates a
viscous cycle in which those who know don’t say, “I am
enlightened and ordinary,” because if they do then they will be
viewed in very strange ways despite what they say; and, because they
don’t tell, no one but them knows. Thus, the strong potential for
nonsensical projections and reactions remains. While sometimes the
masses are fed manure and kept in the dark, if they are fed nothing
at all then they will often invent manure to feed themselves. No one
is happy to learn that perfection in some ordinary sense is
impossible, and some will continue to seek the perfect guru,
community or even self for years despite the fact that such things do
not exist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have few qualms
about blaming those who currently do know for not doing more to
debunk these myths and for not being willing to speak out loudly
against the large amount of nonsensical, magical thinking that is out
there, though I can just as easily understand why they may not be in
any mood to take the heat. As things currently stand, all the
attention and confusion that can come from revealing one’s wisdom
and understanding can often not seem to be worth it, despite how much
one may want to help others. This can be particularly true if one
does not want to be a guru or member of the Dharma Jet Set but just
wants to help people learn this stuff without becoming some kind of
odd object of obsessive adoration or criticism.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It seems that you
can only help those with very clear, strong, and noble motivations
who are willing to actually listen and also be intelligent and
realistic about their relationship to you as a fellow human being and
with whom your personality seems to fit fairly well. Further, you can
only help those who will actually practice, engage and inquire. This
turns out to be a very small group most of the time. You could also
say that you can only teach those who didn’t really need you to
teach them in the first place, as they were going to do it anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is possible,
though not necessarily advisable, to drop all kinds of really glaring
and even tacky hints that one has attained to mastery of some aspect
of the amazing states and stages of the spiritual path and yet have
no one show even the slightest sign that they have picked up on them.
Even more bizarre is how few people, having been directly and
unambiguously told that they are around someone who has attained to
some deep level of mastery of this stuff by standard methods, will
actually ask reasonable questions about how they could do the same.
Even more surprising is how few of those who do ask good questions
will then use this practical information wisely. As Bill Hamilton put
it, “I have a treasure of infinite value that nobody wants.” He
was only barely exaggerating, even as regards many of those who
consider themselves “meditators” and “Buddhists.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Thus, out of
practical self-preservation and a reluctant respect for the fact that
most people seem not to want to hear about actual mastery of this
stuff, the majority of those who do master concentration and/or
insight practices tend to not talk about it, or only to a very few
(see <u>Saints</u> <u>and</u> <u>Psychopaths</u>, by Bill Hamilton,
for an interesting discussion of some of these issues, particularly
the etiquette of enlightenment). All this contributes to the
“Mushroom Factor.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Lastly, there seems
to be a somewhat odd lack of support for up-and-coming potential
teachers. One of my friends has commented that it can be much easier
to get enlightened than to get “lineaged,” i.e. officially
acknowledged that you are a qualified teacher and a reasonable enough
person to be allowed to teach, have students referred to you, be a
part of the monitoring process that keeps teachers on the up and up,
and that sort of thing. Two of my very best, most dedicated and
accessible teachers were not officially sanctioned, despite their
high attainments, great teaching ability and extensive knowledge of
spiritual practice. Also, there often seems to be little clear
articulation of roles that occupy the middle ground, little well
developed sense of apprenticeship, little sense of intermediate
territory between fully lineaged teacher and student. The degree of
these issues varies by tradition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is true that
there are some good reasons why the senior teaching establishments
are slow or reluctant to allow new teachers into the carefully
guarded inner circles. There are certain individuals who possess the
mastery needed to be a teacher but are not good choices for other
reasons, with mental pathology and odd personality traits being chief
among them. There are those whose political skills have been such
that they have managed to get sanctioned despite the fact that they
were not qualified to teach at the level they claimed they could,
with predictable associated problems following suit.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, current
senior teachers, many of which are the first generation of Westerners
to be so, do not yet seem to be quite as comfortable giving sanction
to new teachers as their Asian teachers tended to be giving sanction
to them. Perhaps this will correct itself given time, as there is a
lot of unused talent out there and a lot of unmet demand for
authentic teachers. On the other hand, making a living as a teacher
can be hard, and who needs more competition for scarce donations or
seats on the front platform at overbooked meditation centers?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is also true that
numerous meditation traditions that have come to the West have many
people teaching in them without the foggiest idea that they are not
at all qualified to do so. The old texts state that one should have
at least crossed the A&amp;P Event to teach, though in the tradition
I come from they consider second path as the standard minimum
requirement for any sort of teaching. Basically, chancing into a path
is impressive, but being able to tag another one demonstrates
reproducible competence. I again blame the Mushroom Factor for this,
as I suspect that if people knew what reasonable standards are for
teachers and that there are actually those who meet these, many would
then realize that they simply shouldn’t be teaching and bow out
gracefully.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Beyond this, there
are also good reasons to question the very concepts of “teacher”
and “student” and the disturbing and often unquestioned rigidity
with which they are sometimes applied. One person may have an
understanding that they share with someone else and then turn around
and ask them a question about something that the person who was a
“student” just moments before is skilled in. I have come to the
conclusion that some of the best teaching happens in conversations
between friends and not in the context of very short, formal
interviews with lineaged teachers who have just flown in for the
week.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The climate of
secrecy surrounding conversations about mastery of these things,
restrictive lineage issues and the rarity of engaging in long, deep
conversations with harried and over committed Jet Set Dharma Teachers
combine to create what I term the “Dharma Underground.” This
refers to loose associations of those who are “in the know” but
not officially sanctioned who cautiously seek one another out,
support one another, and exchange ideas about how to go deeper in
ways that have everything to do with friendship and empowerment and
little to do with formal lineages or rigid concepts of “teacher”
and “student.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Often such
conversations occur in “silent” retreat centers or in other ways
that involve breaking some of the rules that may be helpful from one
perspective but also defend the semi-arbitrary privileges of the
lineaged elite while disempowering and marginalizing others with
valuable and accurate knowledge and experience to share.
Interestingly, when reading the old texts I often get the feeling
that a significantly more egalitarian, balanced, and friendly style
was much more the model that occurred in the early Buddhist
community, and I often long for its return.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is interesting
that, unlike Tantric traditions and many others, the Theravada does
not have any formal vows of secrecy regarding the details of mastery
of its practices. Perhaps they would just be needless overkill.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5682_1179888903"></a><a name="35__SO_WHO_THE_HECK_IS_DANIEL_M"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_123"></a>
35. SO WHO THE HECK IS DANIEL M. INGRAM?</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I suppose that if I
am going to rant about how most dharma teachers do not do a good job
of clearly stating what they know, what they teach, etc. then I
should try to avoid being a complete hypocrite and thus answer some
of those questions here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here’s my Western
Teacher Bio the way I would have it on a retreat center brochure:
“Daniel is a Double Aquarian from North Carolina who prefers to be
called ‘Dharma Dan,’ ‘dude’ or simply ‘Honored Archmystic,
Sir.’ His favorite movie is ‘Raising Arizona.’” Just kidding!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let’s try that
again: “Daniel is an extroverted Gen X intellectual. He is known
for his pronounced enthusiasm, lip-flapping, grandiosity,
eccentricity, and calling people on their stuff and shadow sides
regardless of whether or not this is helpful or even accurate. He is
an arahat and has a solid mastery of the basic concentration states
from the first jhana to Nirodha Samapatti, including the Pure Land
Jhanas. He also has a solid knowledge of Buddhist theory and the
texts, and because of these three areas of expertise considers
himself a qualified teacher. He was also authorized and encouraged to
teach by a lineaged abbot of the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition. When it
comes to insight practices, he has standards so high, exacting, and
uncompromising that only those who are dedicated practitioners are
likely to find them helpful. On the other hand, he is a firm believer
that if people simply practice the basic techniques recommended by
the Buddha they can be very successful and awakened meditators. He is
one of the rare teachers who will talk about insight directly and
answer nearly any question about dharma practice without using code,
covering things up or watering things down. Daniel is a diehard
Mahasi Sayadaw fan, though he is very happy whenever he sees people
trying to master any of the world’s great mystical traditions and
thus considers himself a pan-mystical evangelist. He is also a
chronic map-monger and technique freak because he has had them work
very well for him. He does not claim to have any special knowledge of
how to live skillfully in the conventional world, but has found that
a positive attitude, non-pretentious kindness, and a sense of humor
will take you a long way. If you imagine that you want to bust out
some hardcore practice but are in fact just looking for a daddy,
shrink, social worker, or someone to help you prop up your
self-esteem, Daniel is unlikely at this stage in his development to
be the best person to help you meet your needs. He considers himself
to be one badass Dharma Cowboy and prefers similar company or at
least those who aspire to be so.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I dare, no, I <i>double</i>
<i>dare</i> any other teacher to be that honest when writing their
next bio, not that they are likely to be given enough space to
disclose anything resembling this much honest and practical
information. A few more things: I crossed the Arising and Passing
Away when I was about 15 and did it again about 4 more times by my
recollection over the next 10 years without formal practice,
technique or guidance. I attained to stream entry at the end of the
first week of my fourth retreat on January 13th, 1996 in Bodh Gaya,
India, in the Thai Monastery. I also crossed the Arising and Passing
Away of second path on that retreat. I attained second path in daily
life while working at the National AIDS Hotline with the CDC in July,
1996. I was in the break room just hanging out. I attained to Third
Path towards the end of 1996, also in daily life, after a retreat a
few weeks before where I crossed the Arising and Passing Away of that
cycle. I attained to Nirodha Samapatti (see the appendix) one month
later, but it would take me a more few years to really nail down hard
samatha jhanas and the formless realms so that I could access them
off retreat.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I was an anagami for
almost 7 years, going through cycle after cycle of progressive
appreciation of the emptiness of ordinary phenomena, with my total
count of what felt like full new paths being about 27. I wrote most
of this book during that time. I also earned a two-year Masters of
Science in Public Health in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at UNC
Chapel Hill and then went on to complete medical school there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then, on April 17th,
2003, on a 21-day retreat at the Malaysian Buddhist Meditation Center
between medical school and my residency, I attained to arahatship. It
happened while I was doing walking meditation on that glorious Spring
morning. I was sick of the cycles of insight and profoundly inspired
by the steady and gentle invitation of the teacher, Sayadaw U
Pandita, Junior, to simply see through the whole thing as he had
done. His calm smile seemed say, “You can do it. Come on! Any day
now.” Always sit with arahats if you possibly can. That’s my
advice, anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I decided that I
would allow no sensation anywhere in the entire wide sense field to
go by without it being clearly known as it was during every single
second of the day. It was a high standard, but strangely enough can
actually be very closely approximated. It was sufficient to do the
trick after about a week of doing that some 20+ hours per day. I
remember attaining to a Fruition, and a few seconds later I noticed
something about the entrance to it and the re-forming of the sense of
a perceiver on the back side of it, and then suddenly the knot of
perception flipped open, everything was the same and yet the
perspective on it was completely different, and my vipassana problem,
once I had stabilized in that understanding, was solved.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I had barely taught
in the previous 6 years as my own practice has consumed most of the
scant free time I had, but a few days after seeing it I told my
teacher I was thinking of teaching again. He shot me an
uncharacteristically sharp glance and said in a forceful and
commanding voice, “Good!”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have learned all
sorts of useful and interesting things since then, but seeing through
the center point was the essential thing. Many, many thanks to
everyone and everything that made all of this possible, from the
people who taught the Buddha to those who carry his knowledge forward
today, from the people who cooked in the meditation centers I stayed
in to the usurious credit card companies that loaned me the money to
keep going on retreats, and for everything else in this wide world
that made it happen: Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In addition to my
successes, I felt very comfortable writing about the many ways that
one can screw up on the spiritual path, either because I had done so
myself, because one or more of my respected dharma companions had
done so or, most often, for both reasons. I can’t tell you how many
stupid things I thought, said and did along the way while in
desperate pursuit of something that was right there all along, and I
continue to make countless errors when trying to spread the dharma
and live my life. The only state, stage or attainment I write about
from theory rather than experience is Buddhahood. There are a few
practical uses for such information. It is potentially useful to
disclose that I have made countless errors on the spiritual path so
that this may counter the notion that I am coming from some useless
“holier than thou” position and also to try to counter in others
the sense that they are the only ones who make numerous errors on the
spiritual path. I hope it was not necessary. As someone wise once
said, “The life of a Zen Master is one continuous mistake,” and
that goes equally for the rest of us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I feel that the most
important positive result that can come from stating, “I know that
of which I write,” is the chance that this might create the sense
that extraordinary things may be understood and attained by otherwise
ordinary people such as and including myself and yourself. I’ve
done this stuff while holding down jobs, having relationships, and
pursuing graduate studies. I did it on a few weeks or months of
retreat time here and there with a lot of daily practice. My total
retreat time from beginning to arahatship was about 8 months with the
longest sit being 27 days. The point that I am trying to make is that
these techniques and practices are powerful and effective for those
who take the time to follow them. If I can convey the sense that this
is true by going on and on about what “I” have accomplished, then
doing so serves a useful function.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another possible
positive outcome is the sense that might be created in some people
that this is not a dead and theory-based tradition that simply
rehashed the semi-mythical glory of long dead gurus and ancient
writings, but a living tradition with validity in our modern times.
The last useful point that might come from someone who has quite
obviously achieved nothing even close to self-perfection saying, “I
have strong mastery of the core teachings of the Buddha,” is that
it might serve to help bring the whole notion of spirituality back
down to earth. I am quite willing to look ridiculous and grandiose if
there is some chance of it furthering that process, though I realize
that it could easily backfire. Consider carefully the differences and
similarities between confidence, arrogance, and empowering others to
realize that they can do it also.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The word to the wise
is: don’t believe me or anyone else! Take the time to verify these
things for yourself from your own direct experience. I could easily
be fooling myself, you or both of us on numerous points and for all
sorts of reasons from innocent to evil. There certainly is a
well-developed and ancient tradition of doing so. However, “my”
attainments shouldn’t matter so much to you, as <i>the</i> <i>only</i>
<i>person’s</i> <i>understanding</i> <i>that</i> <i>will</i> <i>really</i>
<i>help</i> <i>you</i> <i>is</i> <i>your</i> <i>own</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My personal
experiences with the “psychic powers” are not yet as fully
developed as the more fundamental areas, but I have enough experience
to be able to help all but the most advanced practitioner of them. As
to scholarship, I feel that reading widely and really considering the
meaning of what one reads and how it might actually be applied is a
very good idea, and have myself read around 150 dharma books, both
traditional and modern. While I have been authorized and encouraged
to teach by a formal lineage, this is a mere formality and not a sure
sign in anyone of real understanding or attainment, much less
teaching ability. Luckily, realizations are not dependent on
conditions such as formal acceptance into a lineage. I have chosen a
lucrative career path that has little to do with meditation, and this
eliminates my financial dependence on the dharma and the temptation
to water things down for mass consumption or popular appeal, as is so
commonly done.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I have found that if
I repeatedly ask those who start talking with me about dharma
practice the questions, “What do you really want and why?” and,
“What would you be willing to do to get that?” I usually come to
the conclusion that they are not really interested in the things I am
interested in (i.e. the things mentioned in this book), and thus I
can turn the conversation to other topics and avoid wasting our time.
Those few who do share some of my interests are my dear companions in
what I call The Dharma Underground, and for them I am extremely
grateful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But enough about me,
let me tell you about my book! I think that I have made my influences
and “humble” opinions on a wide variety of other subjects very
clear throughout this work. To be truthful, sometimes I have picked
up this book and thought, “Goodness gracious, what a harsh rant.
What a heap of reductionist dogma, false certainty, pretentiousness
and my own neurotic stuff. I pity the poor, innocent, and
pathologically nice, mainstream, ritualistic, disempowered Buddhists
unfortunate enough to have picked this thing up and simply been
kicked in their soft and flabby posteriors by it to little good
effect.” On other days I have picked it up and thought, “Wow,
this really is the book that I wished I had read all those years ago
when I decided to really go for it. It would have been so extremely
helpful to have had so many details about high-level practice laid
out this clearly, so many myths dispelled, so much honesty about what
the path is and isn’t. What a joy it is that there are books that
convey such an enthusiastic and empowering view on these practices.
Maybe there will be a few people out there who just needed a little
prodding to realize their full potential as great and powerful
meditators. Wouldn’t it be great if I can find a way to get this
book into their hands.” I hope that you had something like both
reactions, as I think that both points of view have some validity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Two interesting and
practical questions for <i>you</i> are, “Who are you in direct
experiential terms?” and “Who is it that knows?” Answer these,
and you will come to know all of this directly for yourself. The
first and last job of anyone who teaches meditation should be to make
herself or himself redundant. This book is the best I have been able
come up with to help accomplish this, as I have tried my best to pack
it with everything useful that I know.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5684_1179888903"></a><a name="36__CONCLUSION_AND_BEST_WISHES"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_124"></a>
36. CONCLUSION AND BEST WISHES</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I do hope that
people will not settle for becoming lost in the dogma of this work,
Buddhism, or of any mystical tradition. I hope that they learn to
actually do the practices that lead to freedom and to the deep
integration of that freedom into their lives. I hope that they have
faith that mastery can be attained. I hope that they will learn to
ask good questions that will help them to accomplish this. I hope
that the culture of Buddhism and the world in general will become
less sectarian instead of more. I hope that students of meditation
will use spiritual conceptual frameworks as tools and not worship
them as sacred dogma. I hope that the huge amount of magical and
fantastic thinking that accompanies spiritual traditions will
immediately vanish from this planet forever.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I hope that those on
the path will learn to talk with each other in ways that are
conducive to clear practice. I hope that any controversial points
made in this little book will promote skillful debate and real
inquiry rather than contraction into fear and dogma. I hope that
people will work towards actual mastery of the path so that they will
no longer need writings such as this one. I hope that people will not
spend their lives lost in content but will also delve deeply into the
liberating truth of the Three Characteristics. I hope that the level
of expectation about what is possible will be raised in a way that is
helpful, and that any jealousy or frustration that results from this
will be skillfully channeled into precise practice and the joy that
it can be done.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">May all of this be
for the benefit of all beings. Should you realize that you wish to
awaken, know that it is within your capabilities and do so.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-after: avoid"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc5686_1179888903"></a><a name="APPENDIX__THE_CESSATION_OF_PERCE"></a><a name="Top_of_Mastering_20core_20teachi_125"></a>
APPENDIX: THE CESSATION OF PERCEPTION AND FEELING <br/>
 (NIRODHA
SAMAPATTI)</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The cessation of
perception and feeling, Nirodha samapatti in Pali, is the highest of
the temporary attainments. As is traditional in the commentaries, I
have included it last. It is discussed in a number of places,
including Sutta #44, The Shorter Series of Questions and Answers, <u>The</u>
<u>Middle</u> <u>Length</u> <u>Discourses</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Buddha</u>, in a talk given by a female arahat named
“Dhammadinna,” and <u>Path</u> <u>to</u> <u>Deliverance</u> by
Nyanatiloka, which draws from that fine text. This attainment can
neither be said to be a state or not a state, nor can it be said to
be purely a concentration attainment or an insight attainment, as it
lacks a basis for analysis, meaning that as there is no experience
that can be analyzed. The word “Nirodha” (meaning “Cessation”)
is also sometimes used without the qualifier “samapatti” to refer
to Fruition, so be careful to keep your terms straight when reading
the old texts or speaking with others about these things. I always
mean the cessation of perception and feeling when I use the word
“Nirodha,” but others may not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is said that
Nirodha can only be attained by anagamis and arahats (those of 3rd
and 4th path) who have some mastery of the formless realms. However,
as Bill Hamilton once said, if you are an anagami or arahat, you are
bound to run into Nirodha Samapatti eventually. There are some
reasons to question whether or not those of the lower stages of
awakening might be able to attain this, or how the ability to attain
this relates to the number of stages of awakening. However, this is
not a subject that I am in a mood to pursue in detail, as I have
learned the hard way that such questions do not help in the end. If
you manage to attain Nirodha, I wouldn’t fixate on the idea that
you have attained at least 3rd path. That said, with a few months of
careful work and focused intent, I was able to attain it after
completing my third cycle of insight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One attains Nirodha
by fusing insight practices and concentration practices in a fairly
gentle way that is much less focused and precise than one would do if
one wanted to attain Fruition. I find it easiest to attain when
reclining, but the first time I attained it I was sitting. There is
nothing that can really be said about this attainment, except for
mentioning things about the entrance, exit, and the consequences of
the attainment. One rises through the samatha jhanas in a very
low-key fashion with some weak awareness of their true nature (the
Three Characteristics), enters the eighth jhana (neither perception
nor yet non-perception), and then emerges from that state. Sometime
shortly thereafter, and without warning or very recent premeditation,
one may suddenly enter the cessation of perception and feeling. It
must be noted that previous interest in attaining this during the
preceding days or weeks tends to increase the chances of this
attainment showing up. As one gets better at attaining this, one can
slip in the inclination (resolution) to attain it after emerging from
the 8th jhana and then forget about it before dropping in.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As my dear old
meditation friend Kenneth so rightly points out, between the 8th
jhana and Nirodha there are a number of states very worth mentioning,
thought the standard texts strangely don’t for reasons I can’t
fathom. We have come to call them Pure Land One and Pure Land Two, as
this seemed as good a thing to call them as anything, thus making a
total of 10 jhanas and Nirodha. Both have as their overwhelming
quality the feeling of deep gratitude in the purest and most profound
sense, with Pure Land Two being a deepening and strengthening of Pure
Land One, though it is also a bit wider and more diffuse. These are
remarkably healing, complete, pervasive, satisfying and heartfelt
states, and the word “pure” applies quite nicely. Early on I
barely noticed them and would jump as fast as I could from the 8th
jhana to Nirodha. Now I know better and take the time to enjoy them.
They write gratitude, beauty, clarity, and contentment onto the mind.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There is also a
state somewhere in that territory that seems basically like pure
presence, like being a super-pervading Watcher, with the quality of
perceiving or awareness itself being the dominant quality. This has a
very different quality from the 6th jhana Boundless Consciousness,
and in my opinion is far superior, more fundamental, and could be
argued as the highest of the states that involve experience. However,
the fact that states that are so clear to me continue to show up that
were never described in the old texts so far as I can tell brings up
another important point: the territory out there past the fourth
jhana and particularly the eighth jhana is very malleable. Kenneth
and I have speculated that the limits to the states attainable out
there are limited by our imagination and concentration skill only,
and I have imagined staging a friendly contest among high-level
practitioners to dream up states that are even better than the ones I
know so that we can play around with attaining them and seeing if
there are any limits to the thing. The large list of all the exotic
heaven realms found in the old texts adds credence to this belief. I
realize this may seem like a contradiction to earlier statements I
have made about being able to master concentration practices
absolutely. It is. Back to describing Nirodha...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The texts rightly
say that, on the entrance to Nirodha, verbal formations cease first,
then bodily sensations, then the whole of mental functioning ceases
when the attainment is finally entered. This is traditionally
explained as correlating to the first jhana, fourth jhana and then
the entrance into Nirodha respectively. However, it may be noticed
that in the three moments before cessation of perception sets in
(during the complete power failure-like entrance) the verbal
formations, bodily formations and mental formations cease in that
order also in three consecutive and definable moments, with the whole
thing taking about 1/3 of a second. Thus, the texts may have a double
meaning, or were misinterpreted by scholars who had not ever attained
Nirodha Samapatti. I say this because it is still typical for many
bodily and verbal formations to arise between the eighth jhana the
entrance to Nirodha, and thus the traditional interpretation does not
hold up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The texts also say
that this attainment may last seven days or even longer, but I don’t
personally know of anyone who has admitted to having this happen.
That doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but would probably require a
long and sustained retreat before hand. The duration of such
attainments will be related directly to one’s concentration
abilities, and these are very dependent upon local practice
conditions and the amount that they have recently been exercised.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Unlike Fruition, one
exits this attainment in the reverse of the way one came in, with
mental formations arising first, quickly followed by physical and
then verbal formations in the characteristic analogue way of the
entrance and with the same timing. After leaving this attainment, the
mind tends to be deeply peaceful and very clear, and one’s body
tends to be very relaxed. The longer the attainment lasted, the
stronger and more durable this effect will be. Thus, I would not
recommend attaining this immediately before entering into situations
that require high-speed decisions or actions. The texts say that one
inclines to solitude or quiet after attaining this state, and in
general I agree.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mention this
attainment because it is one more of those things that is found today
but has often been relegated to the realm of myth and legend or has
been forgotten entirely. It is not that Nirodha is necessary, but it
definitely is a good and useful thing to be able to attain. In fact,
I have not yet spoken with anyone who had attained it who didn’t
consider it among the absolute King Daddy of meditation attainments
other than arahatship, as the depth of its afterglow never fails to
impress and amaze. Hopefully, mentioning it will raise the standard
to which people feel they can reasonably aspire, which is basically
the whole goal of this book.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One more little
morsel for you brave adventurers... I have noticed that the easiest
time to attain Nirodha is usually a few weeks after attaining a path,
when the vipassana jhana aspect of the progress of insight is
becoming clear and a nice degree of mastery has been attained in that
Review phase. However, it has this nice/nasty habit of helping to
precipitate a new progress cycle, as the level of clarity gained in
its wake is impressive. Thus, one may go from the best highs of a
Review phase and Nirodha’s glorious afterglow to the 3rd ñana, A&amp;P
and the Dark Night quickly. In fact, this seems to be a very natural
part of many cycles of anagamis who also know the samatha jhanas and
formless realms.</p>

practice well,</p>
